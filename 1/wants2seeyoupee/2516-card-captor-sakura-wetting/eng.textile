Card captor sakura omorashi story

Chapter 1: oops

It all started one morning when a young girl named sakura was running late, as usual, and raced down the street on her skates. She was 10 years of age with short brown hair and wearing her grade school sailor uniform, with her bright pink skates and pads on. As she rushed down cherry tree street she saw her brother toya and his friend yukito. They were wearing there usual high school uniforms and yukito was riding his bike. There time together was cut short as they neared her school and said there farewells as her school day progressed she felt uneasy, like something was going to happen but she didn’t know what, this made her even more nervous, so to try and calm herself she drank bottles of water, that didn’t help, on her way home she could feel her bladder filling but it wasn’t very bad. As she entered her house, she found a note from her father,

I have a lecture at the university and your brother will be working late tonight, so don’t worry about making us dinner tonight, oh and be careful going into the basement, the door has been sticking lately

Love dad

She plopped down on the couch and thought about what to make for dinner, but her thoughts were interrupted by a rattling from the basement, all alone she grabbed her baton and headed for the basement but remembering her dads note she grabbed a box from nearby and wedged it in the door, as she headed down the stairs, the rattling got louder, after a few minutes she turned down the final isle of books and….

Nothing was there, she released a big sigh, then noticed one of the books had a faint glow, as she picked it up the lock on the side clicked open, she slowly opened the book and found a deck of cards, she thought to herself “cards?” and then as she picked up the first one she realized her bladder was suddenly really full, she figured the adrenaline from the scary noise in the basement must have blocked out the feeling of her bladder filling. As she turned for the bathroom she picked up the card from the top of the deck, it had a picture of a lady with her hair being blown about, she then read the name on the bottom of the card

“The windy?”

As the words echoed in the dark quiet basement a fierce gust swept threw the room, as the book lit up and the wind took the cards they flew threw the ceiling and into the sky, as the wind started to die down she thought she heard a slam, to her dismay the torrent of wind had blown the box that was holding the door open away, she didn’t have time to think about the flying cards, her bladder was screaming for release, and it got it, she fell to her knees as the hot yellow liquid poured into shorts full blast, the dark spot grew quickly as did the puddle, after about 2 minutes the stream stopped and she had tears running down her face, then she heard a voice from behind her

“uhhh- its ok little girl, everyone has an accident every now and then”

She jumped and turned around quickly, to see a flying yellow bear with a stupid grin on his face

To be continued….

Sorry if its not very good...
