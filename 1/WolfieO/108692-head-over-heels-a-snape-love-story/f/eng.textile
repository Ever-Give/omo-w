(Still waiting for my posts with the story in it to be approved.)

This story has been on my mind for a long time. I used a bit of help to write it, because I suck at getting my thought's out. I can't take full credit. But it was very fun putting it together and I will take credit for the storyline. I do not own any characters that belong to JKR.

This is a Snape romance story with omorashi tones. His love interest is the one who does the wetting, not Snape. No descriptive porn scenes, but there are love making scenes that are tasteful (I think).

Omorashi isn't much of a porn link for me as much as it is a comforting and reassuring thing.

The theme of control comes up a lot in this & it's pretty long.

This is more of a romance/feel good story, so if that's what you're looking for I hope you like it. If not, sorry I suck 😅

### Chapter One: Returning to Hogwarts

The golden light of sunset bathed the imposing silhouette of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in an almost ethereal glow. Olivia Black stood at the castle’s gates, her heart pounding with a mix of anticipation and nerves. The stone walls loomed above her, just as they had when she was a child, but now they seemed more monumental, more suffocating in their grandeur. She had forgotten how heavy the air could feel around the castle, thick with history, secrets, and the distant echoes of spells long cast.

Her hands were clammy as she reached up to push back the wild curls of her hair—red, frizzy, and rebellious as ever. It tumbled out from beneath her cloak, like a fiery cascade she’d never quite learned to tame. There were freckles scattered across her pale face, which had always seemed to burn a bit too easily under the sun. Her blue eyes, now more serious than the wide-eyed child she had once been, scanned the gates of her old school, feeling both foreign and familiar at once.

Olivia had been a Slytherin, the house that prized cunning and ambition above all. She had fit in well enough, earning her place among the sharp-tongued, often misunderstood students who had always been one step ahead of their classmates. Back then, she had always worked hard to remain unnoticed—her awkwardness, her insecurities, her secret—none of it ever visible to the prying eyes of Hogwarts students. The secret was a heavy burden she carried silently; she learned how to conceal it with practiced grace. A bladder problem that no one knew about. It had plagued her since childhood, though it wasn’t something she could easily share. Managing it had been a constant struggle, and even now, as an adult, it was something she always had to keep in check.

But that was the past. Today, Olivia was no longer a teenager desperate to fit in. She was an adult, a capable, well-educated woman ready to take on the challenge she had never dreamed she would: a paid internship at Hogwarts, working directly with the man who had both terrified and fascinated her throughout her school years—Professor Severus Snape.

As she walked up the familiar cobblestone path to the school’s entrance, she couldn’t suppress a feeling of awe. It wasn’t just the grandeur of the school that left her breathless—it was the realization that she was stepping back into the world she had once been a part of. She had been away for so long, pursuing a career in the wizarding world, and now the opportunity to return to Hogwarts felt like both a privilege and a responsibility.

The heavy oak doors swung open before her, revealing a house-elf, slightly bent at the waist, who greeted her with a clipped, formal bow. “Ms. Black, Professor Snape is expecting you.”

“Thank you,” Olivia said, her voice steady despite the small flutter in her chest.

The house-elf led her through the winding hallways, which still smelled faintly of old books and potions, a scent that instantly reminded her of her days as a student. Students meandered through the halls, heads down and chattering in hushed tones, their eyes casting curious glances in her direction. She wasn’t sure if they recognized her, but she quickly dismissed the thought. It hardly mattered. The past was the past.

When they finally arrived at the entrance to Professor Snape’s office, the house-elf gave a soft, respectful nod and then left her to her own devices. Olivia stood for a moment, hesitating as she reached for the door handle. There was something about stepping into his office that felt like stepping into the lion’s den.

She took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

Professor Severus Snape stood behind his desk, his dark eyes narrowing slightly as he appraised her, as if sizing her up. His black robes swirled around him like a shadow, his posture as rigid and commanding as ever. His presence was immediately overwhelming, and Olivia instinctively felt her shoulders tense under his scrutiny.

“Ms. Black,” Snape said in his low, deliberate voice, his words carrying a tone of disapproval that she couldn’t quite place. His gaze lingered on her for a moment too long—his dark eyes sweeping over her features, from the wild red hair to the slight dusting of freckles across her nose, to her pale skin and blue eyes. She could tell that he was assessing her appearance, as he had done to so many students before. There was something calculating in the way he observed her, as though he didn’t entirely believe she was capable of handling what he expected of her.

“Professor Snape,” Olivia said, offering a small, polite nod. She straightened her back, trying to quell the growing anxiety in her chest. “It’s a pleasure to be here.”

Snape’s eyes narrowed, and he glanced at the small satchel she carried by her side, which held her ingredients and supplies. “Is it?” he said, his voice dripping with a barely concealed disdain. “I’m sure you’re eager to begin. The internship, I trust, was something you requested, yes?”

Olivia nodded, a bit thrown by the harshness in his tone, but she refused to let it show. “Yes, Professor. I’m eager to learn from you and assist in any way I can.”

There was a long, heavy pause as Snape continued to observe her, his expression unreadable. Finally, he spoke again, his words carrying a sharp edge. “You are aware of the expectations? The work here will not be light, Ms. Black. You will be expected to contribute in ways that go beyond simple menial tasks.”

Olivia met his gaze. “I understand, Professor. I’m ready for whatever you require.”

Snape’s lip curled slightly in what could almost be interpreted as a sneer. “Very well. I suppose that’s to be determined.” He gestured toward the workbench in the corner of the room. “You may begin by assisting with the lesson plans for next week. I will provide you with the necessary materials. After that, we’ll see what use I can make of you.”

Olivia nodded again and moved to the bench, feeling the heat of Snape’s gaze following her every movement. She could sense his disapproval, though it was tempered with the cold, calculating professionalism she’d always known from him. It wasn’t the welcoming environment she had hoped for, but it was better than nothing. And she had a job to do, whether Snape respected her or not.

As she moved through the task of organizing the materials on the workbench, she felt a familiar anxiety creep up from her stomach to her chest. Her bladder—a problem she’d managed for years—was beginning to remind her of its presence. She stiffened, taking a quick, shallow breath. This wasn’t the time or place to worry about it, but the constant pressure she felt was difficult to ignore. She told herself it was just nerves, just the anxiety of being back here after so many years.

The hours passed quickly as Olivia worked. Snape remained in the background, a silent figure who only occasionally issued terse instructions or corrections. His aloofness and general lack of enthusiasm made it clear that he had little respect for her presence here—if anything, he seemed irritated by it. But Olivia pushed through, doing everything she could to prove she was capable, to show him that she was more than the uncertain girl he might have remembered.

As the evening wore on, Olivia felt the weight of her discomfort growing. Her bladder problem was becoming more difficult to ignore, but she didn’t want to draw attention to herself. She excused herself quietly, hoping Snape wouldn’t notice. He didn’t, of course—he was too absorbed in his own work to care.

She stepped out into the corridor, breathing a small sigh of relief. The familiar tension in her chest had eased for the moment, but she knew this was just the beginning. Working at Hogwarts again, under Snape’s watchful eye, was going to be far more challenging than she had anticipated.

Still, she couldn’t deny the thrill that ran through her as she looked back at the towering walls of the castle. She was here. And she would make the most of it—no matter how difficult, no matter how much Snape might resist. Hogwarts was her home. And she was determined to carve her place in it.

###

### Chapter Two: Preparing for the Students

The moon hung high in the sky, casting long, silver beams of light through the tall windows of Professor Snape’s office. Olivia sat at the workbench, still reviewing the lesson plans for the upcoming week. The quiet of the room was punctuated only by the soft scratch of her quill as she took notes, the occasional flicker of a candle’s flame, and the soft sound of Snape’s breathing as he busied himself with organizing his ingredients for the potion-making demonstrations.

She had hoped that after the first day, working with Snape would get easier. But she could feel the weight of his disapproval still hovering in the air. He was a difficult man, and every move she made felt scrutinized, tested. But she knew better than to let it faze her. She was here to prove herself, and she would do just that.

Tomorrow would be the first real day of preparations for the arrival of students—those curious, eager minds who would soon fill the classrooms. She couldn’t help but feel a small thrill of anticipation at the thought. She had never taught before, but she had always been fascinated by the process of learning. And now, she had the chance to be a part of that—if only in a small, behind-the-scenes way.

But as the excitement began to build inside her, she felt a familiar unease twist in her stomach. It wasn’t just the weight of her responsibilities that caused the discomfort—it was the ongoing, unrelenting pressure of her bladder issue, which she had learned to manage in various ways over the years. As a child, she had been humiliated by her condition, her secret so closely guarded that even her closest friends never knew the truth. She had never wanted to be seen as weak or abnormal. But now, as an adult, she had found a solution that gave her some semblance of privacy and dignity.

Pull-ups. She wore them under her robes, thin, discreet, and utterly necessary for managing her condition. It wasn’t something she discussed with anyone, of course—not even Snape, who had already shown little respect for her presence here. She knew he wouldn’t understand. To him, she was just another intern—someone he didn’t have time to regard with the care or empathy a person like her might need. But she had long since accepted the necessity of it. The pull-ups gave her control over something that had once seemed uncontrollable.

They were a tool—nothing more, nothing less. A tool she used to maintain her privacy, her dignity, and most of all, her confidence.

Olivia paused for a moment, adjusting her posture as she felt the telltale pressure starting to build. She reached into the small bag she’d brought with her—a bag that contained more than just the lesson plans and ingredients. It held extra supplies, backup plans for moments like this. The last thing she wanted was to be caught unprepared, especially in front of Snape. It wasn’t the kind of thing she wanted to draw attention to, and she had managed to avoid it so far.

The pull-ups were something she had learned to incorporate into her routine—quietly, discreetly. She didn’t let them define her, and she didn’t allow herself to feel embarrassed by them anymore.

With a deep, steadying breath, she grabbed the necessary item from her bag and headed to the small washroom down the hall. She could hear the muffled sound of Snape’s voice coming from the other side of the office door as she made her way back to the room, but she paid it no mind. He wasn’t concerned with her personal matters. As far as he was concerned, she was just another intern he had been forced to accept.

When she returned to the office, she found Snape’s expression as unreadable as ever. He was standing by a large cauldron, stirring the contents slowly with a silver spoon. The smell of the potion he was preparing was faintly pungent, but Olivia didn’t mind. It was familiar, and it brought her back to her years in his classroom—those same cauldrons, those same smells, those same moments when her heart raced with the fear of failure.

“Ms. Black,” Snape’s voice cut through the silence, his eyes flicking to her. “Have you completed the notes for the lesson plan?”

“Yes, Professor,” she replied, moving to stand beside him at the workbench. She kept her posture straight, her hands clasped in front of her as she tried to push down the lingering tension in her chest.

Snape didn’t acknowledge her words, but his sharp gaze lingered on her for a moment longer than usual. His expression remained as cold as ever, but Olivia could tell that something in him had shifted since the first day. Maybe it was the fact that she hadn’t backed down in the face of his aloofness, or maybe he was simply used to her presence by now. Either way, she could feel the slightest shift in the air.

“We will need to prepare for the students tomorrow,” Snape said, his voice low and commanding, as always. “You will assist in organizing the ingredients and ensuring everything is in place. There’s no time for mistakes.”

Olivia nodded. “Of course, Professor. I’ll make sure everything is ready.”

“You may also help in overseeing the preparations in the classrooms,” Snape added, turning away from the cauldron and moving to another workbench across the room. “The students will arrive in two days, and I expect everything to be in order. Do not make the mistake of thinking this will be an easy task.”

“I won’t,” Olivia said, her voice steady. She felt a small surge of determination. Despite his lack of enthusiasm, this was her chance to prove herself. To show him—and to show herself—that she belonged here, that she could be more than just the girl who had once sat in the back of his classroom, hoping not to be noticed.

Snape didn’t respond, though his eyes lingered on her for a moment before he turned back to his potion. Olivia felt a flicker of unease once again, but she pushed it away. She had a job to do, and she would not allow herself to be distracted by something as trivial as her own discomfort.

The next few hours passed in a blur of preparation. Olivia worked quickly, moving between the desks and cauldrons, making sure the supplies were ready for the arrival of the students. She could hear Snape muttering to himself as he prepared the potions, his movements precise and methodical, as they always were. His sharp, almost imperceptible glances toward her didn’t escape her notice, but she kept her focus on the task at hand.

Eventually, Snape seemed to grow more at ease with her presence. His cold demeanor never quite disappeared, but he stopped giving her the same sharp glances he had in the beginning. She could almost sense a begrudging respect forming between them, even if it was unspoken.

As the night wore on, the pressure in Olivia’s bladder grew again, but she didn’t allow herself to become distracted. She had learned to manage it, to push through.

In the end, she finished organizing the ingredients for the first set of lessons, and as she glanced at the clock, she realized that it was late. The students would be arriving soon, and it would be her job—no, her responsibility—to make sure everything was in order.

She knew that the next few days would bring more challenges, more moments of doubt and discomfort. But she also knew that, despite everything—despite Snape’s attitude, despite her own hidden struggles—she was ready for it.

She wasn’t the same girl she had been when she walked through those gates as a student. She was stronger, more confident, and, most importantly, she knew exactly what it meant to fight for her place in a world that didn’t always make room for her.

And no matter what, she was going to succeed.

Chapter Three: The Welcoming Feast

The Great Hall was alive with energy, the long tables crowded with students from each house, their voices echoing off the enchanted ceiling, which shimmered with the stars of the night sky. The Sorting Hat ceremony had just concluded, and new first-years sat nervously, eagerly awaiting their new lives at Hogwarts. The atmosphere was thick with anticipation, the old magic of the castle settling around everyone like an ancient spell.

Olivia Black sat at the far end of the Slytherin table, tucked between some of the other professors and staff, her eyes scanning the sea of students. They were so young, so eager, and she couldn’t help but feel a small tug of nostalgia. The first-years reminded her of herself when she had sat nervously on the same benches, hoping to make her mark in a school that seemed both vast and intimidating.

Her focus, however, wasn’t solely on the students. She could feel the weight of the tension in the air—the tension that seemed to radiate off Severus Snape, who was seated at the staff table, his dark eyes never straying far from his duties. She had learned quickly that Snape’s disapproval wasn’t something to take personally—it was just the way he was. He treated everyone with the same coldness, which Olivia had quickly realized could be both a blessing and a curse.

"Olivia Black, is it?" came a deep, jovial voice that interrupted her thoughts. She looked up to see none other than Hagrid, the half-giant Keeper of Keys and Grounds, his big, bushy beard and wild hair unmistakable in the crowd.

"That’s me," Olivia said, smiling as she stood from her seat. “Good to see you, Hagrid.”

“Good to see ye too! Been a long time, eh?” Hagrid’s voice boomed as he enveloped her in a bear hug before she could say anything else.

The squeeze took her by surprise, and for a split second, the pressure on her bladder flared. Olivia stiffened, her breath catching as she felt the all-too-familiar twinge of discomfort. But then she remembered. The pull-up she was wearing, so discreet and lightweight, held firm. The pressure didn’t overwhelm her, and she managed to steady herself before anything could go awry.

“Thanks, Hagrid,” she said, her tone light but still with a hint of discomfort, as she forced a smile. She took a step back and, with a pointed glance toward the staff table, added, “You’re still as strong as ever, I see.”

Hagrid chuckled, his booming laugh making a few nearby students look over in curiosity. “Aye, well, I’ve been keepin’ up with the animals! And how’s life treatin’ ye, then?”

“I’m doing well,” Olivia said, keeping her voice calm, though she felt the tension of the moment as her bladder continued to remind her of its presence. “It's been quite a while since I’ve been here, but it’s good to be back, even if the castle hasn’t changed a bit.”

“Aye, that’s Hogwarts for ye.” Hagrid gave her another pat on the back, and she fought not to wince. “We’ve missed ye around here. Got quite a few new faces this year. I reckon we’ll see some good folk, eh?”

“Let’s hope so,” Olivia replied, trying to shift her focus away from the discomfort growing in her lower abdomen. “How’s the magical creatures class this year?”

“Busy! Got a whole bunch of first-years interested in creatures this year, and we’ve got a few new breeds to show ‘em. Should be a good term. You’ll have to pop by the forest sometime—could always use someone with your knowledge around.”

Olivia grinned, her usual sassy confidence starting to return. “I’d be happy to. But no promises—I don’t think I’ll be the first one volunteering to go into the Forbidden Forest.”

“Ha! I can’t blame ye there. But you know, a bit of danger now and then never hurt anyone,” Hagrid said with a wink, his thick eyebrows wiggling.

“Except for the students you’ve sent there, no doubt,” Olivia quipped, leaning in a little, her voice tinged with playful sarcasm.

Hagrid chuckled loudly, causing several heads to turn. “Fair point, fair point. But ye know what they say—learning’s better when yer heart’s poundin’!”

Before Olivia could respond, a soft, authoritative voice interrupted them. “Hagrid, I do hope you're not encouraging Ms. Black to engage in reckless behavior,” said Professor Minerva McGonagall, the Transfiguration Professor, with a raised eyebrow. “Some of us still have standards.”

Olivia turned with a grin. “I can handle myself, Professor McGonagall. Just don't make me get into any duels with you.”

McGonagall’s lips twitched upward ever so slightly, her stern demeanor softening in Olivia’s presence. “I have no doubt of that. But remember, the students are watching you, Ms. Black. We must set an example.”

Olivia laughed softly, a bit of sass in her tone. “I think they’ve seen enough examples of me already. Besides, it’s not like I’m going to start waving my wand and casting curses. You know me better than that.”

“Indeed,” McGonagall replied, though her sharp gaze softened. “I’m glad to see you’ve come back with a sense of humor.”

“I didn’t leave it behind,” Olivia said with a wink. “Just one of the perks of being a grown-up.”

McGonagall’s eyes twinkled briefly. “Let’s hope your maturity lasts through the year.” She turned her gaze to Hagrid, who was still grinning broadly. “Hagrid, we must all return to our duties. The feast is not over, and the students have yet to enjoy their dessert.”

Hagrid nodded, reluctantly letting go of Olivia. “Aye, Professor. Always a pleasure to see ye, Olivia.”

“Same here,” she said, her smile genuine. “Take care, Hagrid.”

As the two of them made their way back to their seats, Olivia’s eyes flicked to Snape. He hadn’t moved much since the Sorting, his posture stiff and formal, his expression still locked in a scowl. He was focused on his plate of food, seemingly uninterested in the ongoing conversations, but Olivia could feel his eyes flicker in her direction from time to time, as if he was aware of every little movement she made.

She took a deep breath, pushing back any lingering discomfort, both physical and mental. She could tell Snape still hadn’t warmed up to her, which didn’t bother her as much as it might have in her younger years. She was used to the coldness by now—used to the way he dismissed her without so much as a glance of approval. But she was determined to show him that she was capable, that she was more than just a distraction, more than just an intern.

Olivia glanced back at the Slytherin table, where students were chatting excitedly, oblivious to the undercurrents of tension that swirled above them. She could feel her own confidence building as the minutes ticked by. Despite the pressures, despite her secret that she kept hidden beneath her robes, she was ready. She wasn’t the same uncertain girl she had been when she first arrived here all those years ago. She was stronger now. And no one, not even Snape, could take that from her.

Just then, Snape’s voice cut through the hum of the Great Hall, sharp and cutting. “Ms. Black, I trust you’re not too distracted by the students to remember your duties?”

Olivia’s eyes flicked to him, and she gave a small, almost teasing smile. “Don’t worry, Professor. I’m still very much in control.”

Snape’s lip curled ever so slightly, his expression unamused. “We shall see, Ms. Black. We shall see.”

Olivia simply raised an eyebrow in return and leaned back in her seat.

Let him watch. She was ready for whatever came next.

###

### Chapter Four: The First Lesson

The first day of teaching had arrived, and the castle was buzzing with energy. The corridors were filled with students heading to their classes, the excited chatter of first-years mixing with the more self-assured tones of upper-year students. For Olivia, it was a rush she hadn’t felt since her own time as a student, albeit now she was on the other side of the desk.

The classroom was just as she remembered it: dimly lit, shelves lined with dusty books and bottles of peculiar ingredients, cauldrons gleaming in rows across the benches. There was a faint scent of herbs and the distant hum of magic that always seemed to hang in the air. As she walked into the room to prepare, Olivia couldn’t suppress the grin on her face. This was her element—the smell of potions, the crackle of spells in the air, the feeling of students hanging on your every word.

Professor Snape was already there, standing at the front of the classroom, his cloak billowing dramatically behind him. His face was unreadable, as always, his black eyes focused on the stack of papers before him. He didn’t glance up when Olivia entered, which was fine by her. She wasn’t expecting a warm welcome.

She moved quickly to the side of the room, organizing the materials and taking note of the students who were beginning to filter in. She could see a few familiar faces—some of the older Slytherins who had been in her year, now sitting at the back, chatting quietly.

"Good morning, everyone," Olivia called out brightly, her voice loud and unrestrained. "Welcome to Potions class! I’m Ms. Black, and today, we’re going to make sure you don't blow yourselves up in the process of learning!"

There was a brief silence. She could feel the students' eyes on her, some of them surprised by her energy, others clearly already prepared to test her limits. She smiled wider, her eyes scanning the room as she continued.

"So, for the first lesson, we’ll be brewing a simple Sleeping Draught. Shouldn’t be too hard for you all—unless, of course, you’re the type to make the potion explode in your face." Olivia paused dramatically. "That does happen sometimes, doesn’t it?"

There was a ripple of laughter, and Olivia couldn’t help but feel a rush of satisfaction. She loved the sound of students laughing, the feeling of engaging them with her own energy. She leaned against the desk, crossing her arms and watching them start to gather their ingredients. It wasn’t difficult to capture their attention. She had always been a bit of a show-off, and teaching allowed her to channel that energy into something productive.

But before she could continue, she felt a sharp, pointed gaze from across the room. Snape, standing stoically at the front of the class, was watching her with a look that could melt stone. He had his arms crossed, his lips drawn into a thin, displeased line.

"Ms. Black," Snape said in his smooth, icy voice, drawing the students’ attention back to him. "Might I suggest you tone down the theatrics? This is a serious classroom, not a circus."

Olivia’s smile faltered, though she quickly recovered. Her brows furrowed slightly, her blue eyes narrowing as she turned to face him.

"Serious classroom? It’s the first day, Professor. They need a little excitement, don’t you think?" Olivia’s tone was playful, but there was an edge to it. She had been teaching for all of twenty minutes, and already Snape was making her feel like she was doing something wrong.

"I don’t need your interpretation of ‘excitement,’ Ms. Black," Snape replied, his voice cutting through the air. "What they need is discipline and focus. Not jokes or unnecessary commentary." His eyes flicked to the students, who were now whispering among themselves, likely enjoying the back-and-forth between the two of them. "You would do well to remember that."

Olivia’s lips tightened, though she kept her outward composure. She didn’t like being told what to do, especially not in front of the students. She was the one standing at the front of the room, engaging them, getting them excited about learning. He didn’t understand that.

"Well, excuse me for not being as boring as you," Olivia shot back, her voice dripping with sarcasm. She knew she was pushing it, but she couldn’t help herself. Snape’s cold, condescending attitude had always rubbed her the wrong way. And now, as her colleague, it still did.

Snape’s nostrils flared, his lips pressed into a tight line. "If you’re here to be a distraction, Ms. Black, I suggest you leave. I am trying to teach a class, not babysit an intern."

"Excuse me?" Olivia’s eyes flashed, the sharp edge of indignation rising. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. "I’m not some silly intern. I have a doctorate in potion-making, just like you. I’m here to teach, just like you. So, maybe you should learn how to treat me like a colleague instead of an inconvenience."

The room fell silent, the students watching the exchange with rapt attention. Olivia could feel the heat of her anger growing, but she didn’t back down. She wasn’t going to let Snape belittle her, not in front of these students, not when she was trying so hard to prove herself.

Snape stood taller, his voice cool and impervious to her outburst. "You will respect the boundaries of this classroom, Ms. Black. I am in charge here, and I expect you to follow my lead."

Olivia clenched her jaw, her heart pounding in her chest. She had never been good at letting insults slide, especially not from someone who had always made her feel small. Snape’s words were cutting, and they stung more than they should have. She wasn’t just annoyed—she was hurt. And in the midst of her mounting frustration, she felt a sharp pressure in her bladder.

The familiar sensation made her stomach drop. She froze for a moment, just long enough for the tension in her lower abdomen to become more noticeable. The argument, her anger, all of it—it had caused her body to react.

She could feel the warmth slowly spreading in her pull-up. It wasn’t enough to be noticeable, but it was there, and the feeling of her secret slipping out of control made her stomach twist. She wanted to scream, but instead, she took a deep, steadying breath. She wasn’t about to let Snape see how much he was affecting her.

Her hands clenched even harder, her nails biting into her palms as she forced herself to maintain composure. She didn’t want Snape—didn’t want anyone—to see her vulnerability. Not now, not after everything.

Snape hadn’t noticed. Of course, he hadn’t. He was too busy trying to keep up his façade of superiority. But Olivia felt the wave of frustration surge through her like a tidal wave. She turned sharply, pushing away the discomfort in her lower body, her anger taking the place of everything else.

"I’m done," she said coldly, her voice sharp as a knife. "I’ll finish the lesson on my own, Professor." She gave a slight nod, but it wasn’t respectful—it was dismissive.

With that, Olivia made her way to the back of the classroom, her movements swift and purposeful, though she was careful to keep her posture as relaxed as possible. She could feel the warmth in her pull-up growing, but the anger coursing through her veins was enough to push it out of her mind for the moment.

She needed to get away from Snape. Needed to get out of the classroom.

"I’ll be back shortly," she muttered under her breath, her voice low and controlled, the sarcastic edge gone from her tone.

Without another word, she swept out of the room, her mind racing with thoughts of everything Snape had said, of everything she wanted to say in return. And as she walked down the stone corridors, away from the classroom and the chaos of her emotions, she told herself one thing.

She wasn’t going to let Snape—*or anyone*—make her feel small again.

Chapter Five: The Aftermath

The rest of the lesson passed in a haze for Olivia. She didn’t look up much from the ingredients she was preparing, nor did she engage with the students beyond what was strictly necessary. Her mind was still reeling from the argument with Snape—his icy words, the sting of his dismissive attitude, and the overwhelming feeling of frustration that had lodged itself deep in her chest.

The potion was meant to be simple—a basic Sleeping Draught, easy to brew and perfect for a first lesson. Most of the students had followed the instructions well, though a few of the younger ones had managed to spill their ingredients or make minor mistakes. Olivia felt little satisfaction from their progress, her own simmering emotions distracting her from the task at hand. She focused on the brewing process but couldn’t help glancing over at Snape every now and then, as if expecting him to continue his criticism. But, for the most part, he remained quiet, his sharp eyes scanning the classroom, occasionally offering a low instruction or correction.

As the last few minutes of class approached, Olivia felt her frustration begin to wane—partially out of sheer exhaustion, and partially because the students had settled into the rhythm of the lesson. The weight of her argument with Snape hung over her like a dark cloud, but she couldn’t let it cloud her professionalism entirely. She had a job to do, and there was no room for self-pity.

When the final bell rang, signaling the end of the lesson, the students gathered their belongings, their chatter rising again as they filed out of the classroom. Olivia stayed where she was, organizing the leftover supplies and packing the students’ unused ingredients back into the cabinet. She didn’t want to look at Snape, didn’t want to hear whatever he had to say, but she knew he would say something. He always did.

"Ms. Black," came his low voice, like a cold wind sweeping through the room.

She turned slowly, forcing herself to meet his eyes, though her heart was still heavy from their earlier exchange.

"You will respect this classroom," Snape said, his voice firm but not unkind. "It is my domain, and while I don’t expect you to remain entirely silent, I do expect you to conduct yourself with professionalism. This isn’t a place for theatrics or unnecessary drama."

Olivia’s stomach tightened, and she felt a twinge of embarrassment creep up her neck. The anger she had felt earlier was gone now, replaced by a dull ache of defeat. Snape was right—this was his class, his territory. And in the end, no matter how much she disagreed with him, she had to admit that she hadn’t handled the situation well.

"I understand, Professor," she said, her voice quiet but steady. She forced herself to meet his gaze, even though she wanted nothing more than to look away.

Snape nodded, his eyes narrowing slightly as if weighing her response. He didn’t say anything further, though she could tell that the conversation was, in his mind, over.

"Good," he replied, his tone softening just a fraction. "Make sure you keep that in mind for the future, Ms. Black."

She nodded, turning to face the board and gather the last of her materials, but the words hung in the air between them. There was nothing else to say. She had admitted her mistake, and now all she could do was move forward.

Once the last student had exited and the classroom door had closed behind them, Olivia took a deep breath. The weight of the argument was still there, but it had lessened somewhat. She had made her point—at least to herself. And Snape had made his.

With the tension in the room fading, she felt the remnants of the discomfort from earlier creeping back. She hadn’t had time to properly take care of herself before class had started, and now the warmth in her pull-up from the argument had shifted into something more noticeable. The accident had been small, but it had still left her feeling unsettled, like a weight she couldn’t shake.

She needed to leave. To get some space. To change.

"I’ll be back in a moment, Professor," she said, her voice clipped but polite as she turned to Snape, who didn’t acknowledge her departure. She knew better than to wait for him to engage. He’d already made his opinion clear.

Olivia left the classroom quickly, making her way down the winding corridors, her footsteps echoing softly on the stone floors. She tried to ignore the faint warmth still lingering in her pull-up. It wasn’t enough to be noticed by anyone, but the discomfort gnawed at her. She needed to fix it—needed to feel normal again.

She made it to the small staff bathroom, locking the door behind her before she took a breath of relief. The room was quiet, and for a moment, she allowed herself to relax. She reached into her bag, pulling out a fresh pair of pull-ups, carefully and quietly changing out of the soiled one. She wasn’t in a rush this time—no one was around, and for the first time since she’d stormed out of Snape’s classroom, she could breathe a little easier.

As she cleaned up, the anger she had been carrying seemed to dissolve into a cloud of quiet frustration. The accident had been small, manageable, but it still stung. She hated that Snape had unknowingly been the cause of it—that his words, his cold dismissal of her, had triggered the feeling of vulnerability she was so careful to hide. But she couldn’t afford to let it get to her. She couldn’t afford to be weak, especially not in front of someone like Snape.

She finished changing and cleaned up, taking a moment to look at herself in the mirror. Her blue eyes stared back at her, and for a second, she didn’t recognize the person who was staring at herself with so much quiet frustration.

This isn’t you, she reminded herself. You don’t let people like Snape make you feel less than you are.

With that thought, she straightened her back, pushed her shoulders back, and headed out of the staff bathroom. She didn’t have time to waste on self-pity. The next lesson was coming up fast, and she had a responsibility to these students. She couldn’t let Snape—or anyone—make her feel like she didn’t belong here.

The next few lessons would be different, she promised herself. She would focus on her students, not the petty rivalry between her and Snape. She had come here to teach, to make a difference—and no amount of tension could change that.

By the time she reached her office to prepare for the next round of classes, she was feeling more in control again. She gathered her notes, organized her ingredients, and took a deep breath.

She could do this. She had to. And as the students filed in for the next lesson, Olivia Black stepped back into the role she had been waiting for.

No more theatrics. No more drama. Just the quiet, steady confidence of a woman who had finally found her place.

###

### Chapter Six: Finding Her Place

The bell rang softly through the corridors, signaling the end of the day’s lessons. Olivia stood by the classroom door, watching the students trickle out, each one murmuring amongst themselves as they made their way back to their respective common rooms. The morning's tension with Snape had mostly dissolved by now, and though her earlier frustration still lingered, it was overshadowed by the relief of getting through her first day of teaching. She was already starting to feel more comfortable in her role, despite the lingering undercurrent of unease around Snape.

Her next task was to regroup, to relax, and to find a way to make Hogwarts feel like home again.

As she made her way down the winding hallways toward the staff room, she passed by the Great Hall, where the teachers were beginning to gather for their evening meal. She could hear the quiet hum of voices rising from within, the familiar sound of faculty members exchanging stories of their summer vacations. Olivia hesitated for a moment, unsure whether she wanted to join the conversation just yet. But then, a familiar voice cut through her thoughts.

"Olivia! Over here!"

She turned toward the sound of the call, and saw Hagrid waving at her from the large wooden doors of the staff room. His broad grin was impossible to ignore.

"Coming, Hagrid," she called back, adjusting the strap of her bag and walking toward him with a small smile.

She entered the staff room, a comfortable, cozy space with mismatched armchairs and a few long tables scattered around. The large windows gave a stunning view of the grounds, framed by the fading light of the evening sky. There were a few teachers already seated at the tables, talking and laughing over their meal. The soft clink of silverware and the rich scent of roast lamb filled the air.

"Ah, there she is!" Hagrid greeted her as she entered, patting the empty chair next to him. "You’ve gotta join us for a bite, Olivia. What’ve ye been up to this summer?"

Olivia sat down, grateful for the chance to finally unwind and join the conversation. She was still adjusting to her new role, but she’d missed the warmth of the teachers’ camaraderie. In her years as a student, she had always found the staff room to be a place of peace and quiet, a sanctuary from the bustle of student life. Now, as a colleague, it felt like a different kind of sanctuary—one that she was beginning to belong to.

"I spent most of my summer in Spain," Olivia said, helping herself to a plate of food. "Studying a few rare potions ingredients, some obscure herbs used in older recipes. You know, the usual."

"Spain?" Hagrid repeated, his eyebrows rising. "Aye, that’s a lovely place. I’m guessin’ ye took some time to enjoy the sights too, eh?"

"Of course," Olivia replied with a grin. "The food, the wine, the warm air. It was hard to leave, honestly." She leaned back in her chair, her tone relaxed as she let her mind wander briefly to the warmth of the Spanish sun. "I even visited a few old botanical gardens and did some research on local magical plants. There’s this one herb, *Lupuluis*, that’s nearly impossible to find outside of the Mediterranean. It’s got a unique effect on potion brewing—perfect for a few... complicated concoctions." She glanced over at Hagrid with a mischievous smile. "Maybe I’ll get you a sample next time. If you’re interested, of course."

Hagrid let out a deep, approving chuckle. "You’ve always had a knack for finding the rare stuff, Olivia. Sounds like a productive summer."

"I’d say so," she responded. "But it was also a lot of quiet time for me. I had a chance to think—about potions, about the future. About everything, really."

Professor McGonagall, who had been listening from across the table, looked up at Olivia with a faint smile. "I’m glad to hear you found time to think, Ms. Black. It’s important to keep a bit of peace in your life, especially when there’s so much... *chaos* here at Hogwarts." Her lips quirked as she glanced at Hagrid, who was busy stuffing his face with mashed potatoes.

"Of course," Olivia replied, not missing the playful tone. "I’ve always found that when I don’t have peace, I end up making a bit of chaos myself. Better to embrace it."

"Sounds like you, alright," McGonagall said with a wink before turning her attention back to the conversation with the other teachers.

"Not as much chaos as yer old friend, though, eh, Olivia?" Hagrid said, his grin widening. "That Snape fellow looks like he’s been in a bad mood since ye got back. Are ye two still, well, y’know...?”

Olivia let out a soft laugh, though it held a slight bitterness. "Snape’s always in a bad mood, Hagrid. Not much has changed there."

"He can be a bit much," Hagrid said sympathetically. "But ye’ll manage. Ye always do."

Olivia smiled softly, appreciating the sentiment, though part of her wasn’t entirely sure how much *managing* she was doing with Snape. She’d hoped things would be easier after her return, but she was starting to wonder if she had underestimated how deeply old rivalries could run.

"Anyway," Olivia said, eager to steer the conversation in a lighter direction, "how about you all? What did you get up to this summer?"

Professor McGonagall looked thoughtful for a moment, then answered, "I spent most of my time in Scotland, visiting some of the old magical sites. There’s always something to be learned from the past. I also found some time to relax—after all, we all need a bit of rest, don’t we?" She gave Olivia a knowing smile, as though she could sense the quieter edge to Olivia’s tone when she spoke about her own summer.

The conversation continued, with Hagrid offering his usual, exuberant stories about his trips to the Scottish Highlands and McGonagall talking about the various magical organizations she’d worked with.

By the time the meal was winding down and the last of the conversation died down, Olivia felt much more at ease. The tension she had felt earlier in the day had lifted, and she was grateful for it. She had missed the easy camaraderie of the staff, and while things with Snape still loomed on the horizon, she was slowly learning that she could find a space for herself in this strange new dynamic.

"Well, I’d better be off," Olivia said, standing and stretching. "I’ve still got some unpacking to do. Make this place feel like home, you know?"

"Of course!" Hagrid boomed. "Get yerself settled, and don’t be shy about popping by again!"

"Not at all," Olivia said with a smile. "I’ll catch you all later."

She left the staff room, making her way down the corridors toward her quarters. Hogwarts felt different now—more alive, more bustling with potential. And as she walked, a faint sense of anticipation grew within her.

Her quarters, while comfortable, were still filled with unpacked boxes. She’d been so focused on getting settled into the routine of teaching that she hadn’t given much attention to personalizing the space. It wasn’t quite the haven she wanted it to be yet, but she could change that.

Olivia entered her quarters and immediately began to unpack more of her things—her books, her clothes, the small trinkets she’d collected over the years. She moved methodically, creating a sense of order in the chaos. Each item she unpacked felt like a small act of reclaiming her space, a small victory over the uncertainty she’d felt during her first few days back at Hogwarts.

She hung up her robes, placed her favorite books on the shelf, and carefully arranged her collection of vials and potion-making equipment on the workbench. With each movement, the room began to feel more like *hers*.

When she finally stepped back to take it all in, she felt a small wave of satisfaction. It wasn’t perfect yet, but it was a start.

Tomorrow would be another busy day, filled with more lessons and more adjustments. But for now, in the quiet of her quarters, Olivia could feel the last traces of her earlier frustration and uncertainty fading into the background.

For the first time since arriving back at Hogwarts, she felt like she was exactly where she needed to be.

### Chapter Seven: Struggling for Control

The next few days at Hogwarts were a blur of activity for Olivia. As the lessons continued, she felt more and more the weight of her new position—no longer a student, no longer a mere observer, but a teacher. It was exhilarating in its own way, but also challenging. Every class, every interaction with students, with the other teachers, felt like a balancing act. And at the center of it all, Olivia could feel Snape’s critical eye watching her every move.

Though she had hoped the tension between them might have lessened over time, it had only intensified. Snape had barely acknowledged her beyond his brief, often terse interactions. Whenever she made a suggestion, a joke, or tried to inject a little energy into the lessons, she could see the disapproval in his eyes. It wasn’t that he outright criticized her in front of the class—he was more subtle, more cutting in his silence. The pointed stares, the cold glares, the way he’d simply take over the class if he didn’t like the way things were going—it was all becoming unbearable.

Olivia was beginning to feel like she was on the defensive. She’d never been one to shy away from competition or from a challenge, but this was different. Snape had the years of experience, the established power, and most importantly, the students’ respect—things that Olivia was still trying to earn.

Today’s class was shaping up to be no different.

She stood at the front of the room, her arms crossed, watching the students begin to assemble their ingredients for the day’s potion—a complex, delicate mixture that required both precision and concentration. Olivia was explaining the importance of timing when Snape entered the room, his dark cloak sweeping behind him as he moved with his usual imposing presence. His eyes flicked over the students briefly before they locked onto Olivia.

“Ms. Black,” Snape began, his voice as cold as always. “Perhaps you would like to focus more on the *precise* aspects of potion-making rather than wasting time with trivial banter.”

Olivia’s stomach dropped slightly, but she refused to show any sign of weakness. She’d been doing her best to get the students engaged, to make the lesson more dynamic, but Snape clearly didn’t appreciate her approach.

“I was simply reminding them about the importance of careful measurement,” Olivia replied evenly, forcing a calmness into her voice she didn’t entirely feel. “Potion-making requires precision, yes, but it also requires attention to detail, focus, and sometimes a bit of... creativity. It’s more than just following instructions.”

“Creativity?” Snape’s voice dropped lower, his eyes narrowing as he walked closer to her. “Potion-making is a science, not a playground for your ‘creative musings.’ If you were attempting to teach these students anything of value, you would have them focus on the fundamentals. They need to understand the rules before they break them.”

Olivia felt a flare of irritation rise in her chest. It was always like this with Snape—his condescension, his constant undermining. She had *earned* her position. She had studied potions for years, and yet, to him, she was still a child in need of correction.

“I am teaching them the fundamentals,” she replied, her voice tight. “But you have to admit, the best potion-makers don’t just follow rules. They learn how to bend them when necessary.”

Snape’s eyes flicked over her, cold and assessing. “You *believe* you understand this, but you lack the discipline to teach it. Your ‘methods’ may work for a few amateurs, but not for students who are learning to brew potions at the level expected of them here.”

Her cheeks flushed with the sting of his words, but she wasn’t about to let him see it. She crossed her arms tighter, refusing to back down. “I disagree. I believe students benefit from a broader perspective. They need to understand why the rules exist, and not just memorize them.”

Snape’s gaze hardened. “Your perspective is irrelevant, Ms. Black. You will follow my lead in this classroom, or there will be consequences.”

The threat in his words was unmistakable, and though she wanted to argue, she knew better than to challenge him too directly in front of the students. The last thing she needed was to embarrass herself further. Instead, she turned her attention to the students, trying to push down the frustration that was threatening to boil over.

“You heard the man,” she said, her voice more cheerful than she felt. “Let’s focus on making sure we get this right, shall we?”

The students nodded, and for the rest of the class, Olivia focused on guiding them through the delicate potion process. But in the back of her mind, she could feel Snape’s presence like a weight pressing down on her. Every time she moved to engage the class, she saw his sharp eyes following her, disapproving, judging. It was exhausting.

The bell rang, signaling the end of the class, and the students filed out, whispering to each other as they left. Olivia stood at the front of the room for a moment, taking a deep breath. She could feel the burn of frustration in her chest, the need to prove herself.

But Snape wasn’t done yet.

“You’ll stay behind, Ms. Black,” he ordered, his voice flat. “I need a word.”

Olivia didn’t respond, just nodded stiffly as the last of the students left the room. She waited, her hands clenched by her sides, as Snape walked to the front of the classroom and leaned against the desk. His eyes never left her, his expression unreadable.

“You’re failing to grasp the importance of control in this classroom,” Snape began, his tone even, but carrying an undercurrent of authority that she couldn’t ignore. “You’ve let your… *enthusiasm* cloud your judgment. The students need to see the value of structure, of discipline. You are not here to entertain them, Ms. Black.”

Olivia bit her lip, her nails digging into her palms. “I’m not here to entertain them, Professor. I’m here to teach them. *All* of them—how to think critically, to approach potions with both precision *and* creativity.”

Snape’s eyes narrowed. “If you insist on continuing this misguided approach, I’ll have to report it. You’ll find yourself reassigned to a different role—one that does not require such… *free-thinking* methods.”

The threat was clear, and it sent a chill down Olivia’s spine. She opened her mouth to argue, to push back, but something in Snape’s cold, impenetrable gaze stopped her. She could feel the power he wielded in this room—how effortlessly he commanded authority. It was something she had always admired from a distance as a student, but now, standing on the other side of the desk, it felt suffocating.

With a resigned sigh, Olivia dropped her shoulders, fighting the urge to let her frustration show. “I understand,” she said, her voice subdued. “I’ll adjust.”

Snape didn’t respond immediately, his eyes lingering on her with a mixture of contempt and something she couldn’t quite place. Finally, he spoke again, his voice low. “See that you do. Your… *methods* might work in some circles, but they will not work here, Ms. Black. Not while I am in charge.”

A knot tightened in Olivia’s stomach. “Understood, Professor.”

“Good.” Snape’s tone softened just a fraction, but the chill was still there. “Now, go. And remember your place.”

Olivia swallowed the lump in her throat, her fingers twitching at her sides as she nodded once more and turned to leave the room. As she walked down the hall, her heart was pounding in her chest. She hated this feeling. Hated that, despite everything she had learned, despite all the years she had spent proving herself, she still felt like an outsider in his world.

The rest of the day passed in a blur. She gave the students their assignments, made small talk with a few of her colleagues, but she couldn’t shake the conversation with Snape from her mind. She felt deflated, like her power in the classroom had been stripped away, and for the first time since arriving back at Hogwarts, she wasn’t sure how to fight for it.

That night, as she sat alone in her quarters, the weight of her frustration finally came crashing down. She had to find a way to take back control—not just for her sake, but for her students’ sake as well. She couldn’t afford to let Snape, or anyone, undermine her anymore.

She wasn’t going to give up. Not yet.

*005*2025-01-21 21:20

### Chapter Eight: A Beast Unleashed

The Great Hall was alive with the clatter of cutlery, the hum of conversation, and the occasional burst of laughter as students and teachers settled into the second dinner of the school year. The warm golden glow of the enchanted ceiling reflected the starlit night outside, and the air was filled with the scent of roasted meats and fresh bread. Olivia sat at the staff table, sandwiched between Professor Flitwick and Hagrid, listening to the latter regale her with tales of his latest encounter with a particularly feisty Blast-Ended Skrewt.

“I tell yeh, Olivia,” Hagrid said, his booming voice carrying over the din, “this one was nearly the size of me hut! Took three o’ us ter wrangle it back in.”

Olivia grinned, swirling her goblet of pumpkin juice. “And here I thought your hut was too cozy to host such lively guests, Hagrid.”

He chuckled, the sound deep and hearty. “Aye, yeh’ve not changed a bit, have yeh? Still quick with yer words.”

“I like to think I’ve only gotten quicker,” she replied with a smirk, though her attention shifted slightly as she noticed Snape’s dark figure seated further down the table. He was sipping his wine, his eyes scanning the room with his usual aloof detachment. The sight of him brought a flicker of irritation to Olivia’s chest, a reminder of the tension between them that still hadn’t eased.

Suddenly, the atmosphere in the Great Hall shifted. A low, rumbling growl echoed faintly through the space, causing heads to turn toward the massive wooden doors. At first, there was silence, broken only by the occasional whisper. But then, the doors flew open with a deafening *bang*, and a massive, clawed creature barreled into the room.

It was a chimera—its lion’s head snarling, its goat’s head bleating in a strange, eerie harmony, and its serpent’s tail snapping dangerously at the air. Gasps erupted from the students as the beast’s golden eyes swept across the hall, its nostrils flaring as it sniffed the air.

“Everyone, remain calm!” McGonagall’s voice cut through the panic, but even she had her wand drawn, her sharp eyes focused on the creature.

“Out of the hall, quickly!” Dumbledore’s commanding tone followed, his calm presence encouraging students to retreat in an orderly fashion toward the nearest exits.

The teachers sprang into action, herding students and casting protective spells to shield them from the chimera’s growing aggression. Olivia was among them, wand at the ready as she helped direct a group of Hufflepuff first-years toward the far doors. The chimera roared, its tail snapping dangerously close to the staff table, sending plates and goblets flying.

“Ms. Black, move!” Snape’s voice rang out, sharp and urgent.

Olivia turned just in time to see the chimera’s lion head swinging toward her, its jaws parting in a menacing growl. She darted to the side, narrowly avoiding the beast’s attack, her heart pounding in her chest. She cast a quick Stunning Spell, but it barely slowed the creature down.

“Professor Snape!” she called, running to his side as he prepared another spell.

“Stay close,” he ordered, his tone clipped as he flicked his wand with precision, sending a jet of red light toward the chimera. The beast recoiled slightly, but it didn’t back down. “We need to regroup with the others. Now.”

Olivia nodded, following him as he led her toward the side of the hall, where a small alcove provided temporary shelter. The sounds of chaos echoed around them—shouts, spells, and the chimera’s guttural growls—but the space they’d found offered a momentary reprieve.

“Are you hurt?” Snape asked abruptly, his eyes scanning her for injuries.

“No,” Olivia replied quickly, though her breath was still catching up with her. “I’m fine. Just a little... startled.”

“Clearly,” he muttered, his tone still carrying its usual edge. But there was something else there, something almost... protective.

Before she could respond, another crash echoed through the hall, and they both ducked instinctively as a chunk of debris flew past them. The adrenaline coursing through Olivia’s veins made her tremble slightly, and she realized, with a sinking feeling, that her bladder had betrayed her in the chaos.

She could feel the warmth spreading, but she didn’t dare look down or move too much. Snape was still beside her, his focus on the battle raging beyond their hiding spot. She clenched her jaw, forcing herself to stay composed, her cheeks burning with embarrassment.

“Stay here,” Snape ordered, his voice low. “I’ll draw its attention. When I give the signal, you join the others and help contain it.”

“Wait, you’re going out there alone?” she asked, her voice sharper than she intended.

“I don’t have time for an argument, Ms. Black,” he snapped. “Just do as I say.”

Before she could protest further, Snape swept out of the alcove, his wand raised as he cast another series of spells to divert the chimera’s attention. Olivia watched, her frustration with him momentarily eclipsed by a strange sense of... gratitude.

Once he was clear of the alcove, she took a deep breath, her mind racing. She needed to act fast. With Snape’s distraction giving her the opportunity, she slipped out of the alcove and joined McGonagall and Flitwick, who were working together to subdue the chimera.

By the time the creature was finally subdued and escorted out of the Great Hall by a team of Aurors, the chaos had settled, and the students were safely accounted for. Olivia’s heart was still pounding, and the faint remnants of her earlier accident made her all the more eager to retreat to her quarters.

As the staff regrouped, Snape approached her, his expression as unreadable as ever.

“You managed not to get yourself killed,” he remarked dryly, though there was a faint, almost imperceptible flicker of relief in his eyes.

“Glad to see you care, Professor,” Olivia shot back, her usual sarcasm creeping back into her tone.

Snape’s lips twitched, but he said nothing more, turning on his heel and stalking away.

Olivia let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, grateful that her secret had gone unnoticed. As she made her way back to her quarters, her mind lingered on the events of the evening—the chaos, the danger, and the strange, fleeting moments of connection with Snape.

She had a feeling this year was going to be even more complicated than she’d anticipated.

###

### Chapter Nine: Unraveling the Mystery

The following morning, the staff convened in the staff room to discuss the previous night’s events. The room buzzed with tension as each teacher recounted their role in containing the chimera and ensuring the safety of the students. Olivia sat near the back, her arms crossed as she listened intently. Despite her calm outward appearance, her thoughts were a jumbled mess.

The creature had been contained, the students unharmed, but the incident was far from forgotten. Olivia’s mind kept drifting back to the moment in the alcove with Snape. His command to “stay close,” the way his eyes had scanned her for injuries, and his unusually protective demeanor—it was all so unlike him. The Severus Snape she knew didn’t have time for sentiment or care, especially not for someone like her.

She shook her head, trying to dismiss the thoughts. *He was just doing his job, nothing more,* she told herself.

“—and we’ve identified the culprits,” McGonagall’s sharp voice cut through Olivia’s internal debate, bringing her back to the present.

“Who?” Flitwick asked, his small frame practically bouncing with curiosity.

McGonagall’s lips thinned into a disapproving line. “A group of eighth-year students. It seems they thought it would be amusing to release the chimera as a ‘harmless prank.’ They didn’t anticipate the creature’s aggression.”

A collective groan rose from the room.

“Harmless?” Hagrid’s booming voice echoed. “That beast could’ve done real damage!”

“Fortunately, it didn’t,” McGonagall said firmly, her eyes sweeping over the room. “The students responsible have been identified and are currently awaiting disciplinary action. They’ll be speaking with Professor Dumbledore and myself later today. Rest assured, they will face appropriate consequences for their reckless behavior.”

Olivia leaned back in her chair, her brow furrowed. Eighth-years—students who were technically adults, who should have known better. She couldn’t help but feel a twinge of anger. These students had put the entire school in danger, all for a laugh.

“It’s a miracle no one was hurt,” Madam Pomfrey chimed in, her voice stern. “If it weren’t for the quick actions of the staff…” She trailed off, shaking her head.

Olivia’s gaze flicked toward Snape, who was standing near the fireplace, his arms crossed and his expression as stony as ever. He hadn’t spoken much since the meeting began, but his presence was as commanding as always.

“Professor Snape,” McGonagall addressed him, pulling Olivia’s attention back to the present. “Your assistance in subduing the creature was invaluable. As always, your skill in handling volatile situations is greatly appreciated.”

Snape gave a curt nod, his dark eyes glinting with something unreadable. “It was a necessary action,” he said simply, his voice as cold as ever.

Olivia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Even when complimented, the man refused to show even a flicker of humility.

The meeting concluded shortly after, and the staff began to disperse, many of them heading off to their respective classrooms to prepare for the day’s lessons. Olivia lingered for a moment, lost in thought.

Her mind kept circling back to Snape. Why had he been so protective last night? It wasn’t like him to care about anyone beyond what was strictly required of him. She could still hear the sharp urgency in his voice when he’d told her to stay close, the way he’d glanced at her with what could almost be described as concern.

*No,* she thought firmly, shaking her head. *I’m reading too much into it. He probably just didn’t want to deal with the paperwork if I got hurt.*

Still, the thought lingered, refusing to be dismissed entirely.

###

Later that evening, Olivia returned to her quarters, still unable to shake the events of the previous night from her mind. She busied herself with unpacking the last of her belongings, hoping the mundane task would distract her.

As she carefully arranged her books on the shelves, her fingers brushed against an old, leather-bound journal. She paused, her lips curving into a small smile. It was the journal she’d kept during her Hogwarts years, filled with notes, doodles, and snippets of her teenage thoughts.

Flipping it open, she found a page from her fifth year, where she’d written a particularly scathing critique of one of Snape’s lectures. *“Does the man ever smile?”* she’d written in bold letters, followed by a poorly drawn caricature of him with exaggerated frown lines.

She chuckled softly, shaking her head. Some things never changed.

Setting the journal aside, Olivia moved to the window and gazed out at the darkened grounds. The moon cast a silvery glow over the castle, and the distant sound of the lake lapping against the shore filled the silence. Despite everything, she couldn’t deny that Hogwarts still felt like home.

And yet, there was an undercurrent of tension she couldn’t ignore—a sense that this year would be different. Her relationship with Snape was strained at best, the students were already proving to be a handful, and she still had her own challenges to navigate.

But Olivia wasn’t one to back down from a challenge.

With a determined breath, she turned away from the window and began preparing for the next day. She might not have all the answers yet, but she’d faced worse before. Whatever this year had in store, she was ready.

Or at least, she hoped she was.

*006*2025-01-21 21:21

### Chapter Ten: A Slippery Situation

The Potions classroom was filled with the familiar sounds of bubbling cauldrons and the occasional hiss of steam. Olivia moved gracefully between the rows of workstations, her sharp blue eyes scanning the students' progress as they prepared their Draught of Peace.

“Don’t over-stir, Mr. Carter,” she called out to a nervous-looking fifth-year. “Unless you’re aiming for a potion that will knock you out rather than calm your nerves.”

The students chuckled nervously, but the boy corrected his technique, muttering a sheepish “Thanks, Professor Black.”

At the front of the room, Snape loomed over his desk, his dark gaze sweeping the classroom with an air of disdain. He had taken a more passive role today, allowing Olivia to lead the lesson while he observed. Or, as Olivia privately suspected, silently judged her every move.

She refused to let it bother her. Instead, she leaned into her usual sarcastic, energetic style, engaging with the students and offering pointed, yet helpful, critiques.

“You call that a potion, Miss Sinclair?” Olivia said as she passed a particularly murky-looking cauldron. “It looks more like swamp water. Fix it before you accidentally summon a boggart.”

The students laughed, and even Miss Sinclair managed a reluctant grin as she adjusted her mixture. Olivia felt a spark of satisfaction. Despite Snape’s constant criticism, she knew she had a knack for connecting with the students.

As she approached the back of the room, however, her foot suddenly slipped on something small and round. Her heart lurched as she realized it was a glass bottle—likely dropped by one of the students. The world tilted, and for a terrifying moment, she felt herself falling backward.

But just as she braced for impact, a strong hand shot out and grabbed her arm, steadying her before she hit the ground.

“Careless as always, Ms. Black,” Snape’s familiar, cutting tone drawled, though his grip was firm and unyielding.

Olivia looked up, her breath catching as her eyes met his. For a moment, everything else seemed to fade away—the noise of the classroom, the bubbling cauldrons, even the students. His dark eyes held hers, and there was something unreadable in his expression, something that sent her heart racing despite herself.

“Thank you,” she managed to whisper, her voice barely audible.

They stayed like that for a second—maybe two—before the spell was broken by a snicker from one of the students.

“Aw, look at that,” someone muttered. “Maybe they *do* like each other.”

The remark was met with muffled laughter, and Olivia’s cheeks flushed crimson. Snape released her arm abruptly, turning toward the class with a glare so icy it could have frozen fire.

“Five points from Gryffindor for inappropriate commentary,” he snapped. “And if I hear so much as another *peep*—” He let the threat hang in the air, his tone leaving no room for argument.

The room fell silent, save for the quiet bubbling of potions. Olivia straightened, brushing imaginary dust off her robes as she tried to compose herself.

“Let’s get back to work, shall we?” she said, her voice steady despite the lingering embarrassment.

###

The rest of the lesson passed without incident, though Olivia couldn’t shake the memory of Snape’s hand gripping her arm or the way their eyes had locked.

When the class finally ended and the students filed out, she lingered behind, busying herself with tidying up the workstations. Snape was already gathering his notes, his expression as unreadable as ever.

“Thank you, by the way,” Olivia said, her tone quieter than usual.

“For what?” Snape replied, not looking up from his notes.

“For catching me,” she clarified, folding her arms. “I might have cracked my head open if you hadn’t.”

He glanced at her then, his expression cool. “I’d rather not have to explain an injury to the headmistress. It was a simple matter of necessity, not charity.”

Olivia’s lips twitched into a faint smile, though she didn’t press the matter. “Still, I appreciate it.”

Snape gave a noncommittal hum and returned to his work, signaling that the conversation was over.

As Olivia left the classroom, her thoughts were a tangled mix of gratitude, irritation, and something else she couldn’t quite name. She wasn’t sure what to make of Snape’s actions—or her own reaction to them—but one thing was clear: her time at Hogwarts was proving to be far more complicated than she’d anticipated.

### Chapter Eleven: A Slow-Burning Flame

Olivia paced back and forth in her quarters, her thoughts a whirlwind of confusion and frustration. It had been two days since the incident in the Potions classroom, and she still couldn’t shake the memory of Snape’s hand on her arm or the way his dark eyes had locked with hers. It wasn’t just that moment, either. Every time she saw him, her heart seemed to betray her, thundering in her chest like a rogue drum.

*What is wrong with me?* she thought, running a hand through her frizzy red hair.

Snape had always been a presence in her life, but never like this. Never the kind of presence that sent butterflies swirling in her stomach or made her feel as though her feet weren’t quite touching the ground. And yet, here she was, pacing her room like a schoolgirl with a crush.

It wasn’t just her heart that was betraying her, though. Her body had started to react in ways she couldn’t control, and it was beginning to worry her. The butterflies in her stomach seemed to ripple through her entire body, and more than once, she’d found herself needing to excuse herself to change her pullup after an interaction with him.

At first, she thought it was just nerves, a harmless side effect of being in close proximity to someone so intense and unreadable. But as the days went on, the issue became more frequent. Every time he brushed past her in the hall, his robes billowing and his dark gaze fixed ahead, her breath hitched, her cheeks burned—and she felt that unwelcome warmth that made her stomach sink.

It was maddening.

###

The next morning, Olivia made her way to the Potions classroom for their first lesson of the day, her resolve to stay calm and composed firmly in place.

Snape was already there, of course, his black robes a sharp contrast against the pale stone walls. He moved with his usual precision, setting up the lesson with an efficiency that bordered on mechanical.

Olivia’s heart gave an unsteady thump as she stepped into the room, her eyes involuntarily drawn to him. She shook her head, trying to focus. *You’re a grown woman, Olivia. Get a grip.*

“Ms. Black,” Snape said without looking up, his tone as sharp as ever. “You’re late.”

“I’m two minutes early,” she retorted, her confidence snapping back into place.

His dark eyes flicked to her, and for a moment, there was the faintest twitch at the corner of his mouth. Was that... amusement?

“Then perhaps you should use that time to organize your notes,” he said smoothly, turning away.

Olivia bit back a sarcastic reply, determined not to let him get under her skin—or notice the way her pulse quickened whenever he spoke to her.

###

As the lesson progressed, Olivia found herself hyper-aware of Snape’s presence. He moved through the classroom with his usual grace, his voice low and commanding as he critiqued the students’ work. Every time he passed her, the butterflies in her stomach erupted, and she had to remind herself to breathe.

At one point, she leaned over to help a struggling Ravenclaw with their potion, only to glance up and find Snape watching her from across the room. Their eyes met, and her heart leapt so violently that she almost dropped the vial she was holding.

“Careful, Ms. Black,” Snape drawled, his voice carrying just enough disdain to mask whatever else might have been lurking beneath it. “We wouldn’t want another accident.”

Her cheeks flamed at that word, though she managed to force a tight smile. “Of course not, Professor,” she replied, her tone light and almost defiant.

But inwardly, she was unraveling. The butterflies were back, stronger than ever, and she could feel the telltale warmth that signaled her body had betrayed her once again.

###

By the time the lesson ended, Olivia was desperate to leave the classroom. She stayed just long enough to gather her things, then muttered a quick excuse and slipped out before Snape could say anything.

Once she was in the privacy of her quarters, she let out a frustrated groan, leaning against the door. This was becoming a problem—a very real, very inconvenient problem.

She changed quickly, her movements sharp with irritation. It wasn’t just the accidents that bothered her. It was the fact that she couldn’t control her reactions to him, no matter how hard she tried.

Her feelings for Snape—whatever they were—were starting to seep into every corner of her life, and she didn’t know how to stop them. Worse, she wasn’t sure she wanted to.

As she sat on the edge of her bed, her thoughts swirling, one thing became painfully clear: this slow burn wasn’t going to extinguish itself.

And she wasn’t sure how long she could keep pretending it wasn’t there.

###

### Chapter Twelve: Tipping Point

The Potions classroom was unusually quiet that morning, the atmosphere heavy with tension. Olivia had walked in with her usual resolve to face whatever Snape threw her way, but she could feel something off in the air. Snape stood at the front of the room, his arms crossed and his gaze colder than usual, as if daring someone to test him.

The lesson had barely started when Snape’s sharp remarks began to chip away at Olivia’s patience.

“Ms. Black,” he said, his voice cutting through the classroom like a blade, “would you care to enlighten the class as to why your instructions on this potion were so… inadequate?”

The students turned to look at her, some of them smirking, others whispering behind their hands. Olivia, standing at the back of the classroom, felt her cheeks flush.

“I gave the instructions exactly as they were outlined in the textbook,” she said, forcing her voice to remain steady.

“Precisely my point,” Snape replied, his dark eyes narrowing. “A competent instructor would know how to elaborate, to expand beyond the bare minimum.”

A few students snickered, and Olivia’s hands clenched into fists at her sides.

“Perhaps you’d like to take over the demonstration, Professor Black,” Snape added, his tone dripping with disdain. “Or would that be too much of a challenge?”

Her heart pounded, and she felt a familiar sting behind her eyes. She blinked rapidly, refusing to let the tears fall. But along with the hurt came a flicker of anger, hot and insistent.

“Maybe I would,” she shot back, her voice rising just enough to silence the murmurs in the classroom. “But it’s hard to teach effectively when you’re constantly being undermined at every turn.”

The room went still. Every pair of eyes shifted between Olivia and Snape, the tension so thick it was almost suffocating.

Snape’s expression darkened, his lips curling into a sneer. “Undermined? If you feel incapable of handling a classroom, Ms. Black, I suggest you reconsider your position here.”

Olivia’s anger flared. “What I feel is that perhaps if you offered a shred of constructive feedback instead of constant criticism, the students—and I—might actually learn something from you!”

A gasp rippled through the room, and Olivia immediately realized she’d crossed a line. Snape’s face was a mask of icy fury, his voice deadly quiet as he said, “Get. Out.”

She hesitated, her breath hitching.

“I said, get out of my classroom,” Snape repeated, his voice cold enough to freeze the air.

Tears pricked her eyes again, but this time they were born of humiliation. She felt her stomach drop—and then, to her horror, the familiar warmth of an accident followed. She stiffened, panic surging through her. She couldn’t let anyone notice.

Keeping her head high, Olivia grabbed her bag and stormed out of the room, her face burning. As soon as she was in the corridor, she broke into a near-run, heading straight for the nearest bathroom.

###

Once inside the safety of the bathroom, Olivia locked herself in a stall and let out a shaky breath. She leaned against the cold stone wall, her hands trembling as she tried to process what had just happened.

The humiliation of being called out in front of the class was bad enough, but the accident… That was the breaking point.

She quickly removed her pullup, her movements mechanical and practiced after years of dealing with this. But this time, she couldn’t shake the wave of shame that followed. The fight with Snape had pushed her to her limit, and her body had betrayed her in the worst possible moment.

As she stuffed the used pullup into the enchanted disposal bag she always carried, tears spilled over her cheeks. She swiped them away angrily, refusing to let herself crumble completely.

*Why does he get under my skin so easily?* she thought, biting her lip to keep from sobbing.

Snape’s words echoed in her mind, each one cutting deeper than the last. She’d known this job would be challenging, but she hadn’t expected him to be so relentless, so determined to break her down.

Yet, as the initial wave of shame began to subside, another feeling took its place. Anger.

She’d made it this far—through Hogwarts, through years of managing her secret, through every obstacle life had thrown her way. She wasn’t about to let Severus Snape of all people make her doubt herself. He couldn't...He....

"Oh no."

### Chapter Twelve: A Missing Lifeline

Olivia stood frozen in the bathroom stall, her breath catching in her throat. She rummaged through her bag for the third time, her hands shaking as she searched every pocket, every hidden compartment.

*No, no, no, this can’t be happening,* she thought, her panic rising.

Her small enchanted pouch—the one that held her backup pullups—was missing. She could vividly remember tucking it into her bag that morning, just like she always did. It had become second nature, a safety net she never thought she’d have to go without.

But now, it was gone.

Her chest tightened as the realization sank in. She had no more changes on her, and the day was far from over. There were still two more lessons to get through, not to mention lunch in the Great Hall and the inevitable chance of running into Snape.

She gripped the edge of the sink, her knuckles white. She couldn’t go back to her quarters just yet—it would draw too much attention. And she definitely couldn’t risk another accident.

“Think, Olivia, think,” she whispered to herself, staring at her reflection in the mirror. Her pale face was even paler than usual, and her red curls were frizzing wildly from the stress.

###

As she paced the small bathroom, she mentally retraced her steps. She’d had the pouch when she left her quarters that morning—she was sure of it. But had she set it down somewhere during the chaos of the morning? Left it behind in the Potions classroom, maybe?

Her stomach churned at the thought. If she had left it in Snape’s classroom, retrieving it would mean facing him again. After their argument, the last thing she wanted was to see that piercing gaze or hear another cutting remark.

But what choice did she have?

Olivia clenched her fists, forcing herself to take deep, steadying breaths. She’d survived worse than this. She could handle it.

She smoothed her robes, checked her bag one last time—hoping against hope that the pouch would magically reappear—and stepped out of the bathroom. Her mind raced with excuses, strategies, and contingency plans as she made her way back toward the dungeons.

Her heart pounded with every step, the echoes of her boots against the stone floors sounding louder than usual. She felt exposed, vulnerable, and unsteady—but she also felt determined.

If her time at Hogwarts had taught her anything, it was how to think on her feet. And she was going to need every bit of that resourcefulness to get through this day.

###

*008*2025-01-21 21:30

### Chapter Thirteen: A Breaking Point

The dungeons were colder than usual, or maybe it was just Olivia’s nerves. Every step toward the Potions classroom felt heavier, her pulse quickening with each echo of her boots on the stone floor.

She hadn’t put on another pullup—she couldn’t. Without her pouch, she had no choice but to hope she could make it through this errand without incident.

*Just get in, grab the pouch, and get out,* she told herself, taking a shaky breath. She tried to focus on the task ahead, but the anxiety gnawed at her, making her hyperaware of every sensation in her body.

As she neared the classroom, the sound of students shuffling out reached her ears. The lesson had just ended. Perfect timing. She pressed herself against the wall, waiting for the last few stragglers to leave before slipping inside.

Her eyes immediately darted to the workstation she had been using that morning. Relief flooded her as she spotted her enchanted pouch tucked beneath the edge of the table. She hurried over and grabbed it, clutching it to her chest like a lifeline.

“Ms. Black.”

The voice was sharp, low, and unmistakable.

Olivia froze, the hairs on the back of her neck standing on end. Slowly, she turned to face Professor Snape, who was standing near his desk, his dark eyes fixed on her like a predator sizing up its prey.

“Stay behind,” he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

She swallowed hard, her stomach twisting. She could feel the tension radiating off him, the unspoken anger simmering just beneath the surface.

As the last student left, Snape closed the door with a deliberate slowness that made Olivia’s palms sweat.

“How *dare* you?” he began, his voice cold and cutting.

Olivia winced, gripping the pouch tighter. “Professor, I—”

“No,” he snapped, silencing her. “You do not interrupt me. What you did this morning was unacceptable. You challenged me in front of my students, undermined my authority, and made a spectacle of yourself.”

His words hit her like blows, each one sharper than the last. She opened her mouth to defend herself, but he pressed on.

“This is *my* classroom, Ms. Black. Not yours. I will not tolerate insubordination from anyone, least of all an *intern* who seems to think she knows better than I do.”

Olivia’s face burned, tears prickling at the corners of her eyes. She could feel the pressure building in her bladder, the telltale signs of her body betraying her again.

“Professor,” she said, her voice shaky, “please... I need to—”

“You need to listen,” he interrupted, his voice rising. “You may have been a promising student once, but you are here to *assist* me, not to challenge me. Do you understand?”

“Professor Snape,” she begged, her voice trembling now, “please, I need to leave.”

He stepped closer, his dark eyes narrowing. “You are not going anywhere until we have finished this conversation.”

She turned, desperate to escape, but his hand shot out, catching her wrist. It wasn’t painful, but it was firm enough to stop her in her tracks.

“Let me go!” she pleaded, panic rising in her chest.

“Not until you understand that your behavior was completely out of line,” he said, his voice unyielding.

And then it happened.

The panic, the stress, the humiliation—it all came to a head. She felt the warmth spreading down her legs before she could stop it, soaking through her robes and pooling on the stone floor beneath her.

For a moment, the world seemed to freeze.

Olivia wrenched her wrist free, her face burning with shame as she looked down at the evidence of her accident. Tears blurred her vision as she met Snape’s stunned gaze.

“I told you to let me go,” she choked out, her voice thick with humiliation and anger.

Snape opened his mouth, but no words came out. For once, he seemed completely at a loss, his usually stoic expression cracking under the weight of what had just happened.

Olivia didn’t wait for him to respond. She clutched her pouch tightly and bolted for the door, her breath hitching as tears streamed down her face.

###

The corridors were mercifully empty as she ran back to her quarters, her mind racing. She didn’t even stop to clean up; she just needed to get away, to put as much distance between herself and Snape as possible.

Once inside her quarters, she locked the door and collapsed onto the floor, her sobs breaking free. She felt exposed, vulnerable, and utterly humiliated.

She replayed the scene in her mind, Snape’s piercing gaze, his refusal to let her leave, the moment she lost control. She had never felt so powerless.

And yet, amid the tears and the shame, a small ember of anger flickered to life. He had pushed her too far.

This wasn’t over.

###

### Chapter Fourteen: Wounds and Whispers

Olivia sat curled up in the armchair by her fireplace, her knees drawn to her chest and her hands gripping a mug of tea she hadn’t touched. The room was quiet except for the occasional crackle of the flames, but her mind was anything but.

The humiliation of the day replayed in her head on an endless loop. The way Snape had looked at her when it happened, the stunned silence that had hung between them—it was unbearable. She had never felt so exposed, so vulnerable.

*How am I supposed to face him again?*

She shook her head, blinking back fresh tears. She’d spent years perfecting the art of hiding her condition, of managing her accidents with dignity and discretion. And in one terrible moment, Snape had ripped that control away from her.

She didn’t bother attending her remaining classes. She couldn’t. The thought of walking into a classroom, of standing in front of students while knowing what had happened—it was too much. She had sent a note to Professor McGonagall, vaguely citing an “illness” as the reason for her absence, and stayed locked in her quarters instead.

But the real question loomed over her like a storm cloud: What would she do tomorrow?

###

In the dungeons, Snape sat at his desk long after the last class had ended, his quill hovering over a stack of essays he hadn’t touched. His mind kept drifting back to the incident with Olivia, replaying every detail with startling clarity.

Her flushed face, the way her voice had trembled when she begged him to let her go, the panic in her eyes just before it happened. And then, the moment itself—how she had stood there, tears welling up as she lost control.

His chest tightened at the memory, and he pressed his lips into a thin line, trying to push the thoughts away. But they refused to be banished.

What disturbed him wasn’t the incident itself—he had seen students lose control in various ways before, whether from fear, embarrassment, or stress. No, what unsettled him was his own reaction to it.

When it happened, he hadn’t felt disgust or disdain. Instead, he’d felt something entirely unexpected: an ache in his chest, an unexplainable pull toward her vulnerability.

And worse, a flicker of… attraction.

Snape leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled as he stared into the dimly lit room. The thought was absurd. He had spent years building walls around himself, cultivating an image of impenetrable control. Yet something about Olivia’s raw, unfiltered humanity—her loss of control in front of him—had struck a chord he didn’t want to acknowledge.

He could still hear her voice, laced with anger and humiliation: *“I told you to let me go.”*

For the first time in years, he felt… guilty. He hadn’t intended to push her to that point, but he had. And now, he couldn’t shake the memory of her teary eyes and trembling voice.

*Pull yourself together, Severus,* he scolded himself. This was not the time to be entertaining such foolish thoughts. She was his intern, his subordinate, and he had no business feeling anything toward her beyond professional irritation.

Still, he found himself wondering if she was all right.

###

Back in her quarters, Olivia finally forced herself to move. She set her untouched mug on the side table and stood, her legs unsteady beneath her. She needed to do something, anything, to distract herself from the storm raging in her head.

She began unpacking the last of her belongings, pulling books and personal items from her trunk and arranging them on the shelves. Her hands worked mechanically, her mind still spinning.

At one point, she paused to glance at her reflection in the mirror. Her red curls were disheveled, her face pale, and her blue eyes rimmed with red from crying. She barely recognized herself.

“Get it together, Olivia,” she muttered, brushing her hair back from her face.

But no matter how much she tried to focus on mundane tasks, the memory of the day’s events lingered like a shadow. And beneath the humiliation and anger, a question gnawed at her: Why hadn’t Snape let her go?

Was it sheer stubbornness? A need to prove his dominance? Or was there something else beneath his cold exterior?

She shook her head, dismissing the thought. It didn’t matter. What mattered was finding a way to face him tomorrow without falling apart.

Olivia set her jaw, determination replacing the shame that had been weighing her down. She would not let Severus Snape—or anyone else—define her.

###

Meanwhile, in his quarters, Snape poured himself a glass of firewhisky, hoping to drown the lingering thoughts of Olivia Black and the unsettling feelings she stirred in him.

But as he stared into the amber liquid, he found himself wondering: Why had her vulnerability moved him so deeply? And why, even now, did the memory of her tear-streaked face make his heart ache in a way he couldn’t explain?

He took a long sip, his expression unreadable as he stared into the flickering flames of his fireplace.

Tomorrow would come soon enough. And with it, the question of whether things between him and Olivia could ever return to normal.

###

That's all for now. Please let me know if you want the rest, I'd appreciate it.

*009*2025-01-25 01:31

I'm still waiting for my posts with the story to be approved.

*012*2025-02-03 19:07

### Chapter Fifteen: The Silent Treatment

The next morning, Olivia steeled herself as she prepared for the day. Her routine was mechanical, deliberate—a way to keep her mind off what had happened. She chose a fresh set of robes, tied her hair back into a loose bun, and made sure her pouch was securely in her bag this time.

*Today will be fine,* she told herself, though her stomach churned at the thought of seeing Snape again. She couldn’t avoid him forever, but she could keep things strictly professional.

When she entered the Great Hall for breakfast, the usual hum of chatter surrounded her. Olivia kept her gaze fixed on her plate as she took her seat at the far end of the staff table, far enough from Snape that she wouldn’t have to acknowledge him.

“Good morning, Olivia!” Hagrid greeted warmly, his booming voice cutting through her thoughts.

“Morning, Hagrid,” she replied with a small smile, grateful for his kindness.

Across the table, Professor McGonagall gave her a nod, but her sharp eyes seemed to linger on Olivia a moment longer than usual. Olivia knew the older witch was perceptive, but she wasn’t about to let anyone pry.

She ate quickly, barely tasting the food, and excused herself before Snape even entered the hall.

###

By the time Potions class rolled around, Olivia had managed to maintain her composure. She stood at the front of the room, arms crossed, her expression carefully neutral as the students filed in.

Snape entered moments later, his dark robes billowing behind him. He cast her a glance, but she didn’t meet his gaze. Instead, she busied herself with organizing the ingredients for today’s lesson, focusing intently on the task at hand.

“Today, we’ll be brewing a calming drought,” Snape announced, his voice slicing through the room like a knife. “The instructions are on the board. Begin.”

Olivia moved among the students, her tone clipped but encouraging as she checked their work. She corrected a Gryffindor who had mismeasured their valerian root and offered quiet praise to a Ravenclaw who had achieved the perfect consistency in their potion.

She avoided Snape entirely, keeping her focus on the students.

###

As the lesson ended, Snape dismissed the students with his usual curt efficiency. Olivia began cleaning up the workstations, still refusing to acknowledge him.

“Ms. Black,” his voice came from behind her, low and firm.

She froze for a moment, then resumed wiping down the counter. “What?” she asked, her tone icy.

“We need to talk.”

“I have nothing to say to you,” she replied, keeping her back to him.

Snape moved closer, his presence looming. “What happened yesterday cannot be ignored. I—”

“I said I have nothing to say,” she interrupted, spinning around to face him. Her blue eyes were cold, her jaw set.

His gaze softened slightly, almost imperceptibly. “Olivia—”

“No,” she cut him off again, her voice rising. “You don’t get to do this. Not after what you did.”

Snape’s face hardened, his usual mask of indifference slipping back into place. “This is about professionalism. You cannot—”

“Professionalism?” she scoffed, her laugh bitter. “You humiliated me. You refused to listen to me when I told you I needed to leave. That’s not professionalism, Professor Snape—that’s cruelty.”

Snape opened his mouth to respond, but she shook her head, cutting him off once more. “I have nothing else to say to you.”

Before he could stop her, she brushed past him, her pace brisk as she headed for the door.

“Ms. Black,” he called after her, his tone sharper now.

But she didn’t look back.

###

Olivia spent the rest of the day avoiding Snape entirely. She threw herself into her work with the other classes, offering her assistance to Professors Sprout and Flitwick when she wasn’t teaching. She forced herself to smile, to engage with the students, to pretend everything was fine.

But beneath the surface, the weight of what had happened still pressed down on her. Every time she thought about Snape—his cold, piercing gaze, his refusal to let her go—it sent a fresh wave of anger and humiliation crashing over her.

She didn’t know how she was going to keep working with him, but one thing was certain: she wasn’t going to let him see how much he had affected her.

###

Meanwhile, Snape sat alone in his office, staring at the stack of essays on his desk without really seeing them. Her words echoed in his mind: *“You humiliated me. You refused to listen.”*

For once, he didn’t have a rebuttal.

###

### Chapter Sixteen: Secrets in the Shadows

The air in the Potions classroom was thick with the heady aroma of simmering ingredients and the quiet murmur of students discussing their assignments. Olivia stood at the side of the room, moving between tables to check on the students’ progress, her blue eyes scanning each cauldron with practiced precision.

Snape loomed near the front, his arms crossed and his expression as impassive as ever. He appeared focused on the lesson, but his gaze would occasionally flicker to Olivia. Specifically, to the small leather bag slung over her shoulder.

She never went anywhere without it. That much was clear. Even when she moved around the room, the bag stayed close, resting on her hip or hanging on the back of her chair. Snape’s curiosity had grown over the past few days, and now it gnawed at him.

“Ms. Black,” he said suddenly, his silky voice cutting through the quiet.

Olivia glanced up, her auburn curls bouncing slightly as she turned to face him. “Yes, Professor?”

“Do tell,” he began, his tone dripping with condescension, “what is so valuable in that bag of yours that you carry it as if your life depends on it?”

The students stilled, their eyes darting between the two professors. Olivia’s cheeks flushed, and her fingers instinctively gripped the strap of her bag.

“That,” she said sharply, “is none of your concern.”

Snape’s lips curved into a faint smirk. “Ah, a mystery, then. How very intriguing.”

“Or,” Olivia shot back, her tone biting, “you could simply mind your own business.”

A few students exchanged wide-eyed glances, and one stifled a laugh. Olivia ignored them, her heart pounding in her chest. She hated how easily he got under her skin, how his words could make her feel both furious and exposed.

###

As the lesson continued, Olivia tried to focus on the students’ work, but her body betrayed her. The tension from Snape’s remark, combined with the lingering embarrassment from their previous confrontation, made her bladder feel uncomfortably full.

She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, trying to ignore the growing pressure. But as she leaned over a student’s cauldron to correct their stirring technique, her body gave out.

A warmth spread between her legs, and she froze, her breath catching in her throat. *Not now. Please, not now.*

Her pullup absorbed the accident, but the humiliation burned all the same. She straightened quickly, her face hot, and murmured an excuse.

“I’ll be back shortly. Carry on,” she said, her voice tight as she headed for the door.

Snape’s eyes followed her as she left, his expression unreadable.

###

When Olivia returned, she felt calmer, more composed. Her bag was still sitting on her chair, but as she approached, she noticed something odd. The flap wasn’t fully closed.

Her heart skipped a beat. She quickly snatched up the bag and secured it, glancing around the room to see if anyone had noticed.

Snape’s dark eyes were fixed on her, and for a moment, she thought she saw a flicker of… something in his gaze. Curiosity? Amusement? She couldn’t tell.

“Did you enjoy your little excursion, Ms. Black?” he asked smoothly.

Olivia shot him a glare. “Yes, thank you.”

As she turned away, Snape’s mind raced. He hadn’t meant to glance inside her bag, but when it had been left slightly open, his eyes had been drawn to it. And unless his imagination was playing tricks on him, he thought he’d seen something unexpected.

A package of pullups.

The realization sent an unfamiliar flutter through his chest, something he couldn’t quite name. He frowned, shaking his head as if to dispel the thought. It didn’t make sense, and yet…

He watched Olivia as she resumed her duties, her shoulders tense but her movements confident.

For reasons he didn’t fully understand, the image of her vulnerability—the knowledge that she carried such a secret with her—stayed with him.

And for the first time, Severus Snape found himself genuinely curious about the woman who had so thoroughly disrupted his orderly world.

###

### Chapter Seventeen: Observations and Obsessions

Severus Snape prided himself on his keen observational skills. It was one of the many tools in his arsenal as a teacher and as a former spy. He noticed everything—every flicker of unease, every errant glance, every slight movement. And lately, his sharp eyes had been focused on Olivia Black.

She thought she was subtle, and to most, she probably was. But Snape saw the patterns. The slight shift in her posture when she stood too long in one place. The way she clutched her bag tightly whenever she left the room unexpectedly. How her voice would quicken, her tone clipped and distracted, as though she were fighting some internal struggle.

At first, he’d dismissed these observations as incidental quirks, nothing more. But the moment he’d glimpsed what was inside her bag, everything clicked into place.

*Pullups.*

The realization should have been met with indifference, perhaps even mild disdain. Yet, to Snape’s utter confusion, he found himself… intrigued. There was something oddly captivating about her vulnerability, her careful attempts to maintain composure. And, against all logic, he found it strangely—disconcertingly—attractive.

He began to watch her more closely, his sharp mind piecing together the puzzle. He noted the precise moments her demeanor would shift: the way her movements became stiffer, her shoulders tightening as though she were bracing herself. How she would glance toward the door, her hand instinctively brushing her bag before excusing herself.

It became a game in his mind, a challenge to pinpoint the exact second she reached her breaking point.

###

During their next class together, Snape stood at his usual post at the front of the room, his dark eyes scanning the students with practiced indifference. But his attention wasn’t on them—it was on Olivia.

She was moving between tables, her voice calm and authoritative as she corrected a Slytherin student’s potion technique. Her red curls glinted in the dim dungeon light, and despite his best efforts, Snape’s gaze lingered on her.

She seemed fine at first, her posture confident, her movements fluid. But as the lesson progressed, he noticed the telltale signs. A slight shift in her weight. A brief pause as she adjusted the strap of her bag. The faintest crease in her brow as she glanced at the clock.

*There it is,* he thought, his lips twitching in something that might have been amusement.

By the time she excused herself, Snape was certain. He watched her go, her steps brisk but not hurried, her bag clutched tightly at her side.

He should have felt smug for unraveling her secret, but instead, a strange warmth bloomed in his chest. There was something deeply human about her struggle, about the way she carried herself with dignity despite the challenges she faced.

And, much to his annoyance, it made her even more attractive in his eyes.

###

Olivia, of course, was completely oblivious to Snape’s observations. She was too focused on managing her condition, on ensuring that no one—especially him—would ever discover her secret.

As she returned to the classroom, she felt a renewed sense of control. Her pullup was fresh, her bag securely closed, and she was ready to finish the lesson.

“Welcome back, Ms. Black,” Snape drawled as she entered. His tone was neutral, but she thought she caught a flicker of amusement in his dark eyes.

“Thank you, Professor,” she replied curtly, brushing past him.

Snape’s gaze followed her, his mind buzzing with thoughts he couldn’t quite sort out. He didn’t understand why her condition fascinated him so much, why the sight of her vulnerability made his heart race.

All he knew was that Olivia Black was becoming a distraction he couldn’t ignore.

### Chapter Eighteen: Unspoken Truths

The dungeons were quiet, save for the faint drip of water from some unseen crevice. The final class of the day had ended, and Olivia stood at her desk, sorting through parchment and ingredients with mechanical efficiency. She wanted to get to her quarters and retreat from the lingering tension that had hung between her and Snape all day.

“Ms. Black,” Snape’s voice drawled from behind her, low and measured.

She stiffened but didn’t turn around. “Yes, Professor?”

“I believe it’s time we had a… proper discussion about the other day.”

Her hands froze mid-motion, gripping a bundle of parchment. She didn’t need to ask what he meant; she knew. She drew a steadying breath and forced herself to continue organizing. “I don’t see the point, Professor. It’s over.”

Snape stepped closer, his dark robes rustling softly. “It is not ‘over.’ I believe you made that abundantly clear by storming out of my classroom and refusing to engage with me since.”

“I had every right to leave,” she replied, her voice tight. “And I’m fine now. There’s nothing more to discuss.”

His patience, already thin, snapped. “You’re ‘fine’? You humiliated yourself, and I—” He cut himself off, his tone softening as he added, “I overstepped. I regret it.”

That made her pause. Slowly, she turned to face him, her blue eyes wary.

“Did I hear that right?” she asked, her tone laced with disbelief. “Are you… apologizing?”

Snape’s jaw tightened. “In my own way, yes.”

“Well, that’s lovely,” she said with a humorless laugh, “but it doesn’t change anything. I don’t want to talk about it, Severus.”

Her use of his first name startled him, but he recovered quickly. “And yet it hangs between us like a specter. You cannot simply bury it and hope it fades away.”

“Watch me,” she snapped, her temper flaring.

Snape’s irritation grew. He loathed her ability to deflect, to dismiss his attempts at resolution. “You’re a fool if you think this can be ignored. I know you better than that, Olivia.”

“No, you don’t!” she shot back, her voice trembling with frustration. “You think you do, but you don’t know anything about me!”

His dark eyes narrowed, and a dangerous edge crept into his voice. “I know what’s in that bag you guard so fiercely.”

The words landed like a thunderclap.

Her breath caught, and her face drained of color. For a moment, she stood frozen, staring at him in stunned silence.

“You… you don’t,” she whispered, but the crack in her voice betrayed her.

Snape’s lips curved into the faintest smirk, though his expression was more thoughtful than cruel. “Don’t I?”

Her gasp broke the silence, and before she could think, her hand flew up, striking his cheek with a sharp slap.

The sound echoed through the empty classroom, both of them frozen in the aftermath. Olivia’s hand trembled as she lowered it, her heart pounding in her chest.

“How dare you,” she whispered, her voice choked with fury and humiliation.

Snape’s expression remained impassive, though a faint red mark bloomed on his pale cheek. “Perhaps I overstepped again,” he said coldly, his voice laced with sarcasm.

She glared at him, her blue eyes blazing with unshed tears. Without another word, she grabbed her bag and stormed out of the room, her footsteps echoing down the stone corridor.

###

Snape stood alone, the sting on his cheek barely registering. He touched the spot where she’d struck him, his fingers lingering for a moment before falling to his side.

He should have been furious, but all he felt was a strange mix of regret and intrigue.

“Fascinating,” he murmured to himself, though the word tasted bitter.

Olivia Black had managed to unravel him in ways no one else ever had. And he wasn’t sure he liked it.

###

### Chapter Nineteen: A Locked Room Confrontation

Severus Snape was not a man prone to obsession—or so he told himself. Yet Olivia Black consumed his thoughts, her defiance and vulnerability replaying in his mind like an unsolvable riddle. The sting of her slap lingered less than the fire in her eyes, a spark that both challenged and intrigued him.

He had tried, in his own way, to bridge the widening chasm between them. Offering extra help during lessons, softening his typically sharp critiques, even going so far as to assign himself to tasks that would keep him near her. But Olivia met each effort with icy distance.

It was infuriating. And unacceptable.

###

That evening, as the last of the students filed out of the Potions classroom, Olivia moved to gather her things. Snape stood at his desk, watching her with an intensity that made the air feel heavy.

“Ms. Black,” he said sharply as she moved toward the door.

She didn’t stop. “Goodnight, Professor.”

Snape’s patience snapped. With a flick of his wand, the heavy classroom door slammed shut, the metallic clunk of the lock echoing through the room.

Olivia froze, her bag clutched tightly to her side. Slowly, she turned to face him.

“What are you doing?” she demanded, her voice low and dangerous.

“We are going to talk,” he said, his tone brooking no argument. “And neither of us is leaving until we’ve resolved this.”

Her eyes narrowed. “Unlock the door, Severus.”

“No.”

Olivia’s heart pounded, a mix of fury and anxiety bubbling in her chest. “You can’t keep me here!”

“Clearly, I can.” He gestured toward the locked door. “And I will, until you stop being so insufferably stubborn.”

Her fingers tightened on the strap of her bag. “You’re out of your mind.”

Snape took a step closer, his black robes billowing. “Perhaps, but I refuse to let this… tension between us continue to disrupt my classroom. You will explain yourself, or we will remain here indefinitely.”

Her stomach twisted, and not just from his words. The pressure in her bladder had been building steadily during the lesson, and now the added stress made it nearly unbearable.

“I can’t do this right now,” she said, her voice strained. “Please, let me go.”

“Not until you tell me why you insist on avoiding this conversation.”

“I don’t owe you an explanation!” she snapped, taking a step back.

Snape’s eyes narrowed. “Oh, but you do. Your behavior has been erratic, disruptive—”

“I’m disruptive?” she cut him off, her voice trembling with anger. “You humiliated me, Severus! You violated my privacy and then made it worse with your snide comments!”

He flinched at the raw emotion in her voice, but he held his ground. “And I’ve tried to apologize, but you refuse to listen. What more do you want from me?”

Olivia’s body stiffened as a sudden warmth spread between her legs. Panic flooded her mind as she realized she couldn’t hold back any longer.

“I need to leave,” she said, her voice breaking.

“Why?” Snape demanded, his dark eyes searching hers. “Why are you so desperate to run every time we have a disagreement?”

She shook her head, tears prickling at the corners of her eyes. “Please, just let me go.”

“Not until you tell me why,” he said firmly, taking another step closer.

Her composure shattered. “Because I can’t do this right now, Severus!” she cried.

Snape’s gaze dropped to the floor, and his sharp eyes caught the faintest sign—a glisten of wetness on the stone beneath her. Understanding dawned, his chest tightening.

“Olivia…” His voice was softer now, laced with something she couldn’t place.

“Don’t,” she whispered, her face burning with shame. “I told you to let me go.”

Her trembling hand reached for her bag, but she couldn’t meet his eyes. She wanted to disappear, to escape the unbearable weight of his gaze.

Snape’s throat tightened as he watched her, a strange mix of guilt and fascination stirring within him. Slowly, he took a step back, his wand lowering.

The door unlocked with a soft click.

“You’re free to go,” he said, his voice quiet.

Olivia didn’t hesitate. She grabbed her bag and rushed out, the sound of her footsteps echoing down the corridor.

Snape stood alone in the silent classroom, his heart heavy with conflicting emotions. He had seen the depth of her vulnerability, and instead of repulsion, he felt something far more dangerous.

Something he couldn’t ignore.

### Chapter Twenty: A Meeting in Shadows

The air in Severus Snape’s office was thick with the earthy scent of old parchment and brewing ingredients. The soft glow of candlelight illuminated the dark, cluttered space, casting long shadows on the stone walls. Olivia sat stiffly in the chair opposite his desk, her hands folded in her lap, her gaze fixed firmly on a stack of papers in front of her.

“Thank you for agreeing to meet,” Snape said, his voice low and measured. He leaned back in his chair, studying her with his signature intensity.

“I didn’t think I had much of a choice,” Olivia replied, her tone clipped. She avoided looking directly at him, her focus instead darting to the bookshelves, the bubbling cauldron in the corner—anywhere but at the man in front of her.

“Work is work,” she added, trying to sound unaffected.

“Indeed,” Snape murmured. He reached into a cabinet, retrieving a dusty bottle of deep red wine and two small glasses. Without asking, he poured the wine, sliding one glass toward her.

Olivia blinked at the unexpected gesture. “What’s this?”

“A peace offering,” he said simply, lifting his own glass and taking a measured sip.

She hesitated, her fingers hovering over the stem of the glass. “I don’t think wine is going to fix anything, Severus.”

“Perhaps not,” he said, his tone dry. “But it may make this conversation slightly more tolerable.”

Her lips twitched, but she quickly smoothed her expression. Reluctantly, she took a small sip of the wine, its warmth spreading through her chest.

“So,” she said, setting the glass down, “what exactly are we planning?”

“The remaining assignments before the Christmas break,” Snape replied, his tone all business. “I suggest we keep the focus on practical application. The students have a tendency to forget theoretical knowledge over the holidays.”

Olivia nodded, grateful for the shift to a professional topic. “Agreed. Perhaps we could assign a project that requires them to brew a potion over the break and document the process?”

“Ambitious,” Snape said, his dark eyes gleaming. “But it could work. The eighth years, at least, should be capable of managing such a task.”

They fell into a rhythm, discussing details and drafting instructions for the assignments. For a moment, the tension between them seemed to ease, replaced by the familiar camaraderie of two colleagues working toward a common goal.

But as the conversation wound down, Snape leaned back in his chair, his glass of wine nearly empty. His gaze lingered on Olivia, his expression unreadable.

“You know,” he began, his voice quieter now, “I understand why you’ve been avoiding me.”

Her body tensed. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

His lips curved into a faint smirk. “Don’t play coy, Olivia. I see more than you realize. I always have.”

Her heart raced, but she forced herself to meet his gaze. “If you have something to say, Severus, just say it.”

He studied her for a long moment, his dark eyes searching hers. “You think your… condition makes you weak. That it’s something to be hidden at all costs.”

Olivia’s breath caught, her cheeks flushing. “I don’t—”

“But it doesn’t bother me,” he interrupted, his tone firm. “Not in the slightest.”

She stared at him, her mouth opening and closing as she tried to process his words. “Why… why would you say that?”

“Because it’s the truth,” he said simply, setting his glass down. “I’ve seen how you handle yourself, the dignity you carry despite your challenges. It’s admirable.”

“Admirable?” she repeated, her voice thick with disbelief. “You humiliated me, Severus. You made me feel small in front of your class, and now you’re saying this?”

“I made a mistake,” he admitted, his voice softer now. “And I regret it. Deeply.”

Olivia’s throat tightened, her emotions swirling in a confusing mix of anger, embarrassment, and something else—something she wasn’t ready to name.

“You don’t know me as well as you think you do,” she said, her voice trembling.

“I know more than you believe,” Snape replied, his gaze unwavering.

For a moment, the room was silent, the tension between them palpable. Then Olivia stood, grabbing her bag and slinging it over her shoulder.

“This conversation is over,” she said, her voice firm.

“Olivia—”

“No,” she cut him off, her blue eyes blazing. “Whatever it is you’re trying to do, just stop. You don’t get to dictate how I feel or how I handle my life.”

With that, she turned and strode out of the room, leaving Snape alone with his thoughts.

He watched the door close behind her, a flicker of frustration crossing his face.

But beneath the frustration, something deeper stirred—a feeling he couldn’t quite name, but one he knew he couldn’t ignore.

###

### Chapter Twenty-One: A Tense Encounter

The late afternoon sunlight slanted through the high windows of the Potions classroom, casting long, golden shadows across the rows of wooden desks. Olivia stood at the front, hunched over a workstation as she prepared ingredients for the next day’s lessons. Her movements were methodical, almost mechanical, as she diced valerian root with practiced precision.

The sound of the door creaking open sent a shiver down her spine. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.

“Miss Black,” Snape’s deep voice cut through the silence like a blade.

Her jaw tightened, but she didn’t stop working. “What do you want, Severus?” she asked without looking up.

“I was under the impression this was still my classroom,” he replied smoothly, his footsteps echoing as he approached.

Olivia sighed, finally straightening and turning to face him. “It’s after hours. Surely you can’t begrudge me a bit of preparation for tomorrow’s lessons.”

“Preparation is not the issue,” Snape said, his black eyes narrowing. “But your tendency to linger where you’re not needed may be.”

She crossed her arms over her chest, meeting his gaze with a defiant glare. “I didn’t realize my work ethic was such a problem for you.”

“It’s not your work ethic I question,” he retorted, his voice laced with sarcasm.

Olivia’s temper flared, but she forced herself to stay calm. “If you have something to say, Severus, just say it.”

He studied her for a long moment, his dark eyes inscrutable. “Your behavior as of late has been… erratic,” he said finally. “Distracted, unfocused.”

Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. “If I’m distracted, it’s because you’ve made this place unbearable,” she shot back.

Snape’s eyes flickered with something she couldn’t quite name—surprise? Annoyance? Amusement? Whatever it was, it only fueled her anger.

“You presume to blame me for your shortcomings?” he asked, his tone dangerously soft.

“I presume to hold you accountable for being a miserable, overbearing tyrant,” Olivia snapped before she could stop herself.

The silence that followed was deafening.

Snape’s expression darkened, and he took a step closer, his towering presence intimidating even in the open classroom. “You will watch your tone,” he said, his voice low and menacing.

Olivia held her ground, though her heart pounded in her chest. “Or what?” she challenged, her blue eyes blazing.

Their standoff stretched for what felt like an eternity, the tension between them almost palpable. Finally, Snape exhaled sharply, his lips curling into a disdainful sneer.

“You are insufferable,” he muttered, turning away and stalking toward his desk.

“And you’re impossible!” Olivia called after him, her voice shaking with anger.

He stopped but didn’t turn around. “If you’re quite finished,” he said coldly, “I suggest you leave. I have work to do, and your presence is… distracting.”

Olivia bristled at the jab but knew better than to push him further. She grabbed her bag and slung it over her shoulder, her movements jerky with frustration.

“Gladly,” she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

She stormed out of the classroom, her footsteps echoing in the empty corridor. As she walked, her anger began to give way to exhaustion, the weight of the encounter settling heavily on her shoulders.

###

Back in his office, Snape sat at his desk, staring at the parchment in front of him but seeing none of the words. His mind was still on Olivia, replaying their heated exchange in vivid detail.

She was infuriating, yes—but there was something else. Something about her fire, her unyielding spirit, that he couldn’t ignore.

With a frustrated sigh, he leaned back in his chair and pinched the bridge of his nose. Whatever it was about Olivia Black that got under his skin, he would have to figure it out—and soon.

Because ignoring it was no longer an option.

### Chapter Twenty-Two: Silent Observations

The classroom was abuzz with the low hum of students brewing their potions, cauldrons bubbling and soft whispers of conversation punctuating the air. Olivia stood at the front of the room, her posture rigid as she observed the students’ progress. She was determined to maintain focus today, even with Severus Snape pacing the rows with his signature scowl.

She had been avoiding him since their last encounter, keeping her responses short and professional, refusing to engage beyond the necessities of teaching. Snape, for his part, seemed content to let her simmer, though his sharp eyes missed nothing.

“Miss Black,” Snape’s voice broke through her thoughts, startling her slightly. “Do remind the class of the importance of precise measurements. Some seem intent on reducing this room to rubble.”

Olivia shot him a look but nodded, addressing the students. “You heard him. Precise measurements, people. Unless you want to explain to Madam Pomfrey why you’re covered in boils.”

A few students chuckled nervously, and Olivia’s lips twitched in a faint smile. But her moment of levity was short-lived.

As she moved toward the back of the room to check on a pair of struggling students, Olivia felt a familiar, unwelcome sensation. Her breath hitched, and panic clawed at her chest. Not now, she thought desperately.

She paused, trying to compose herself, but the telltale warmth spread, and she knew it was too late. She quickly shifted her posture, tightening her legs together and forcing a neutral expression onto her face. She couldn’t afford to let anyone notice—not here, not in front of him.

But Snape was watching.

From his vantage point at the front of the room, he had noticed the slight stiffening of her movements, the way her shoulders tensed and her gaze darted briefly downward. To anyone else, it might have seemed insignificant, but to Snape, who had been quietly studying Olivia for weeks, it spoke volumes.

His eyes narrowed, and he leaned slightly against the desk, pretending to inspect a parchment while his attention remained fixed on her. He couldn’t say why he was so attuned to her every move, but something about her vulnerability fascinated him.

It wasn’t just the way she carried herself with such determination despite her struggles—it was the way she fought to hide them, to maintain control in a world that seemed determined to challenge her at every turn.

He watched as she subtly adjusted her bag, angling it against her side as if to shield herself. The students around her were too focused on their cauldrons to notice anything amiss, but Snape saw it all.

When Olivia excused herself a moment later, her voice steady but her steps hurried, Snape felt an unexpected pang of something he couldn’t quite identify. Concern? Curiosity?

Once the door closed behind her, his mind wandered. If he were honest with himself, he would admit that he admired her resilience. But more than that, he wanted to understand her. To know why she built such thick walls around herself, and why the cracks in those walls drew him in like a moth to flame.

###

When Olivia returned to the classroom, her face was composed, but there was a tightness around her eyes that betrayed her. She avoided Snape’s gaze entirely, focusing instead on helping a student whose potion had turned an alarming shade of green.

Snape allowed her the space, though his mind was far from focused on the lesson at hand.

He had thought about apologizing before, but now the idea seemed imperative. He didn’t want to simply mend the rift between them; he wanted to earn her trust. And he knew that wouldn’t happen with vague gestures or empty words. He would have to find the right moment, the right way to show her that he saw her—not just her strength, but her struggles, too.

As the class came to an end and the students filed out, Snape lingered by the door, his dark eyes tracking Olivia as she gathered her things.

“Miss Black,” he said quietly, his tone softer than usual.

She glanced at him briefly, her expression guarded. “Yes?”

But the words he wanted to say didn’t come. Instead, he gave a curt nod, stepping aside to let her pass.

Olivia hesitated for a moment, her blue eyes searching his face for something she couldn’t name. Then, with a small sigh, she walked past him and out into the corridor.

Snape watched her go, his thoughts a tangled web of frustration and resolve. If he could just find the right way to break through her defenses, perhaps he could finally understand the woman who had so thoroughly captivated him.

###

### Chapter Twenty-Three: A Game of Wits

The day had been long, and Olivia was more than ready to retreat to her quarters for a quiet evening alone. Her bag, as always, was slung over her shoulder, the weight of it both reassuring and grounding. She had no plans to linger in the teachers’ lounge, but she had left a few scrolls there earlier in the day and needed to retrieve them before calling it a night.

The lounge was empty when she arrived, the soft crackle of the fireplace the only sound in the room. She set her bag down on the nearest table and began gathering her things, mentally running through tomorrow’s lessons.

What she didn’t notice was the silent figure slipping into the room moments after her, his black robes blending seamlessly with the dim shadows.

Snape watched her for a moment, his expression inscrutable. She was muttering something to herself as she arranged the scrolls in her arms, oblivious to his presence. His dark eyes flicked to her bag, sitting vulnerable and unattended on the table. A flick of his wand, and it disappeared into the folds of his robes before she even turned around.

He stepped back into the corridor, his lips curving into the faintest hint of a smirk.

###

When Olivia returned to her quarters and reached for her bag, her heart sank. It wasn’t there.

Panic began to set in as she mentally retraced her steps. She was certain she had it in the teachers’ lounge—but had she left it behind? Or worse, had someone taken it?

The thought of anyone discovering what was inside made her stomach churn. She needed to find it, and fast.

###

She stormed back to the lounge, her heart pounding in her chest. When she pushed the door open, she stopped short, her breath catching in her throat.

Snape was standing by the fireplace, her bag dangling casually from his hand.

“Looking for this?” he drawled, his tone laced with amusement.

Olivia’s cheeks burned. “Where did you—why do you have my bag?” she demanded, striding toward him.

“I found it,” he said smoothly, holding it out to her. “You really should be more careful with your belongings, Miss Black.”

She snatched it from his hand, her irritation clear. “I didn’t misplace it,” she snapped. “You took it.”

Snape raised an eyebrow, his expression one of mock innocence. “Accusing me of theft, are we? How very bold of you.”

Olivia glared at him, her blue eyes blazing. “You’re impossible.”

“And you’re predictable,” he shot back, his gaze sharp as he studied her face. “Running back here the moment you realized it was gone. I suppose that bag is rather important to you.”

Her heart raced, and not just from anger. The way he was looking at her—intense, unrelenting—made her feel exposed, as if he could see right through her.

“I don’t have time for your games, Severus,” she said, her voice trembling slightly as she turned to leave.

But as she moved to step past him, her body betrayed her. The stress of the moment, combined with the intensity of his gaze, caused her to lose the tenuous control she had been holding onto. Warmth spread between her legs, and she froze, her breath catching in her throat.

Snape noticed.

He said nothing at first, but his dark eyes flicked downward, then back up to her face. His expression was unreadable, but Olivia thought she saw the corner of his mouth twitch, as if he were suppressing a smile.

“Something wrong, Miss Black?” he asked, his voice deceptively calm.

She shook her head quickly, clutching her bag tighter against her side. “Nothing,” she said, her voice tight.

Snape’s smirk deepened. “You’re rather flustered,” he remarked, his tone almost teasing. “Don’t tell me you’re catching feelings.”

Olivia’s eyes widened, and she felt heat rush to her face. “You’re unbelievable,” she snapped, pushing past him and storming out of the room.

Snape watched her go, a mixture of amusement and intrigue flickering in his dark eyes. There was something about her, something he couldn’t quite put into words. And he had a feeling he wasn’t done unraveling the mystery of Olivia Black.

###

*013*2025-02-03 19:13

### Chapter Twenty-Four: Unraveling Thoughts

The castle was quiet in the late evening hours, the halls lit by the soft glow of enchanted torches. Olivia sat in her quarters, staring at the flickering flames in her fireplace as her thoughts swirled in a chaotic mess.

Why did Severus Snape seem so interested in her? Why did he keep pressing, making comments that felt like needles under her skin? Did he know about her condition? The idea made her stomach twist with anxiety.

She clutched a cup of tea in her hands, seeking its warmth to steady herself. **Surely, he couldn’t know the full extent,** she thought. But the way he looked at her, the snide remarks he made—it was like he saw through every carefully constructed wall she had built over the years.

She was used to people teasing her in subtle ways. She had learned long ago to let most comments slide off her back, but this was different. With Snape, every word, every glance, seemed targeted, deliberate. She wasn’t sure if he was trying to be cruel or if he was simply... curious.

Her chest tightened at the thought of him mocking her. **What if he’s doing this to humiliate me?** The idea sent a wave of shame coursing through her, and she set the tea down before her trembling hands could spill it.

And yet... there was another part of her, quieter but persistent, that didn’t believe he was being cruel. There had been moments—fleeting, almost imperceptible—where she thought she saw something softer in his gaze. Something that hinted he wasn’t teasing out of malice but rather an inexplicable fascination.

The realization made her heart ache. Because no matter his intentions, there was one undeniable truth: **she had feelings for him.**

It wasn’t just his intellect, though she admired his sharp mind and mastery of magic. It wasn’t just his commanding presence, though that alone was enough to make her pulse quicken. It was the way he carried himself with a quiet strength, the way he seemed to understand loneliness in a way few people could.

But feelings didn’t change facts.

Olivia glanced at her bag sitting on the edge of her bed, the weight of its contents a constant reminder of her reality. Her condition was a part of her life—a part she had spent years managing in silence. It had shaped who she was, forced her to be resilient and resourceful. But it was also a source of deep shame, a secret she guarded fiercely.

How could someone like Severus Snape ever understand that? How could he see her as anything other than the vulnerable, imperfect woman she was?

Her throat tightened as she imagined confessing her feelings to him, only for him to look at her with disdain. He wasn’t the type to mince words, and the thought of him rejecting her in his cold, cutting way made her chest ache.

“No,” she whispered to herself, shaking her head. “It would never work.”

Even if he wasn’t mocking her, even if there was a part of him that cared, her condition would always be a barrier. She couldn’t risk opening herself up to that kind of pain, couldn’t bear the thought of him looking at her differently if he ever knew the full truth.

And yet, no matter how much she tried to convince herself, the feelings wouldn’t go away. Every time she saw him, her heart raced. Every time he spoke to her, even when his words were biting, her pulse quickened.

Olivia sighed, leaning back in her chair and closing her eyes. She needed to get a grip. Tomorrow was another day, another round of lessons to prepare for. She would keep her distance, focus on her work, and bury these feelings deep where they couldn’t hurt her.

But as she sat there, the image of Snape’s dark eyes lingered in her mind, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t shake the longing that had taken root in her heart.

###

### Chapter Twenty-Five: A Fragile Confession

The final lesson of the term had ended, and the castle buzzed with the energy of students eager for Christmas break. Olivia was packing away her materials in the Potions classroom when Snape approached her, his presence quiet but commanding as always.

"Miss Black," he began, his voice calm but firm. "I’d like to extend an invitation for dinner this evening. As colleagues, of course."

Olivia blinked, caught off guard. Dinner? With him? "Dinner?" she echoed, her tone uncertain.

Snape gave her a slight nod, his expression unreadable. "We still have one last matter to discuss before the break. Consider it... a professional courtesy. I insist, and I’ll pay."

There was no arguing with that tone, so Olivia reluctantly agreed.

###

The restaurant in Hogsmeade was cozy, its atmosphere warm and inviting. Snow fell gently outside, muffling the world beyond its frosted windows. Snape chose a secluded table in the corner, ensuring their conversation wouldn’t be overheard.

Olivia was stiff at first, her unease clear as she studied the menu. But after a glass of wine and some tentative conversation about their lesson plans, she began to relax.

"How are you finding the transition back to Hogwarts?" Snape asked, his dark eyes observing her closely over the rim of his glass.

"It’s... surreal," Olivia admitted, swirling her wine. "I never thought I’d be back here as a teacher, or, well, an intern."

"You’ve handled the challenges admirably," Snape said, surprising her with the hint of praise.

She glanced at him, searching his face for any sign of sarcasm. Finding none, she hesitated before offering a small smile. "Thank you."

But the easy moment was short-lived. As the conversation continued, Snape began steering it toward her.

"You’ve always had an air of secrecy about you," he remarked, his tone almost casual. "Even as a student."

Olivia stiffened, her grip on her wineglass tightening. "I don’t know what you mean."

Snape’s gaze was unrelenting. "I think you do."

Her heart pounded as she avoided his eyes, pretending to focus on her meal. "Why are you so interested?"

He leaned back slightly, his expression as unreadable as ever. "Because I’ve observed you, Olivia. I’ve noticed the moments when you freeze, the way you excuse yourself from lessons. It’s... curious."

Olivia’s chest tightened, and she set her glass down with a trembling hand. "It’s personal," she said quietly, her voice barely audible over the hum of the restaurant.

"I’m aware," he replied, his voice low but gentle. "That’s why I’m asking."

Something about his tone, his unwavering attention, made the dam inside her crack. She had been holding onto this secret for so long, and now, under the weight of his piercing gaze, it felt impossible to keep it locked away.

She took a deep breath, steeling herself. "I have a medical condition," she began, her voice shaking. "I’ve had it since I was a child. I can’t control... when I have accidents. It’s not something I can fix or cure. I manage it the best I can—with pullups."

Snape didn’t react immediately, which only made her more nervous. She braced herself for a snide remark, for teasing or judgment, but none came.

Instead, he leaned forward slightly, his dark eyes searching hers. "And the moments during lessons," he said carefully. "When you freeze... is that when it happens?"

Her throat tightened, and she nodded reluctantly. "Yes," she whispered.

He was quiet for a moment, his expression thoughtful. Olivia’s chest ached with the tension of waiting for him to say something, anything.

"Why do you want to know?" she finally asked, her voice breaking.

Snape’s gaze flicked to hers, something unreadable in his expression. "Because it doesn’t bother me," he said softly.

Olivia stared at him, her mind reeling. "What?"

He shook his head slightly, as if dismissing the conversation. "Perhaps we should continue this discussion elsewhere," he suggested, his tone measured. "My quarters, perhaps?"

She hesitated, unsure of his intentions but unable to deny her curiosity. After a long pause, she nodded, following him into the snowy night.

### Chapter Twenty-Six: Truths Unveiled

The warmth of the fire whiskey spread through Olivia's chest as she held the glass tightly in her hand. Snape’s quarters were dimly lit, the fire crackling softly in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across the room. She sat stiffly on the edge of the armchair, her nerves frayed from the unexpected intimacy of the evening.

Snape sat opposite her, his own glass in hand. His dark eyes were fixed on her, his expression unreadable but intense. Olivia was already regretting agreeing to this, but the fire whiskey in her veins gave her a semblance of courage she hadn’t felt in years.

He leaned forward slightly, his voice low and deliberate. "Olivia, if this is too much, you’re free to leave. But I’d like to ask you some questions."

Her stomach twisted, and she hesitated. Part of her wanted to bolt, to escape the vulnerability of this moment, but another part of her—a braver part—stayed rooted in her chair. She nodded slowly.

Snape set his glass down on the table between them. "Do you know when it’s going to happen?" he asked, his tone clinical but not unkind.

She blinked at him, her cheeks flushing. "Not always," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. "Sometimes I can tell, but other times… it just happens. I’ve learned to manage it as best I can."

"Manage it how?" he pressed, his gaze unwavering.

Her grip on the glass tightened. "By wearing… what I wear," she said, her voice shaking. "And by being careful. I plan my day around it. I try to avoid situations where I might get too stressed or distracted, but it’s not perfect. It never is."

He nodded, absorbing her words. "Do you still use the bathroom?"

Olivia’s cheeks burned, and she downed a gulp of fire whiskey, the heat spreading through her veins. "Yes," she said quickly, almost defensively. "When I can. It’s not like I don’t try. But it doesn’t always work the way it’s supposed to."

The room was silent for a moment, save for the crackle of the fire. Olivia avoided his gaze, staring into her glass as if it held the answers to her discomfort.

"I imagine it must be exhausting," Snape said quietly, his tone softer now.

She glanced up at him, surprised. "It is," she admitted. "But it’s my life. I’ve dealt with it for so long that I don’t know anything else."

Snape picked up his glass again, swirling the amber liquid thoughtfully. His posture was uncharacteristically relaxed, and Olivia could tell the fire whiskey was loosening his usual restraint.

"There’s something… intriguing about it," he said after a moment, his voice lower than before.

Olivia’s heart skipped a beat, her breath catching in her throat. "What do you mean?" she asked cautiously.

He looked at her, his dark eyes locking onto hers. "Watching you lose control," he said, his words deliberate, "there’s something about it that’s... attractive."

Her jaw dropped, and she stared at him in disbelief. "You can’t be serious," she said, her voice trembling.

"I am," he said simply, holding her gaze. "I’ve tried to ignore it, to rationalize it, but I can’t deny what I feel."

Olivia’s mind was spinning, her emotions a chaotic mix of shock, embarrassment, and something she couldn’t quite name. She set her glass down with shaking hands. "Do you mean that?" she asked, her voice barely audible.

Snape leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable once again. "I do," he said softly.

For a long moment, neither of them spoke, the weight of his confession hanging heavy in the air. Olivia’s heart raced, her thoughts spiraling as she tried to process what he had just said.

Snape’s words lingered in the room like a spell, binding them both in the charged silence. Olivia couldn’t bring herself to look away from his dark, searching eyes. Her heart raced in her chest, her mind a chaotic blur of emotions she couldn’t name, let alone process.

"Why would you feel that way?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Snape leaned forward slightly, his gaze unrelenting. "It’s difficult to explain," he admitted, his voice low and almost hypnotic. "But there’s something about the vulnerability, the raw humanity of it… it fascinates me."

Her stomach fluttered, and she felt her face flush. She should have been horrified, insulted even, but instead, she felt a strange thrill course through her. She swallowed hard, unable to look away from him.

"You’re serious," she said, more to herself than to him.

"I am," he replied, his tone firm yet gentle.

Before she could think of what to say, Snape leaned closer, his dark eyes never leaving hers. Olivia froze, her breath catching in her throat as he closed the distance between them. His lips brushed against hers softly, tentatively, as if testing the waters.

The kiss sent a shiver down her spine, and her heart felt like it might burst from her chest. She leaned into him, her hands gripping the edge of her chair for support as the world around them seemed to melt away.

But then, amidst the swirl of emotions and sensations, she felt it—a telltale warmth spreading beneath her. Her stomach dropped, and panic seized her as she realized she was having an accident in her pullup.

She pulled away abruptly, her face burning with shame. "I—I need to go," she stammered, avoiding his gaze.

Snape didn’t move, his eyes studying her intently. It was as if he already knew. "Olivia," he said softly, his voice calm but firm.

She froze, her back turned to him.

"Did you have an accident?" he asked, his tone devoid of judgment, only curiosity and something else she couldn’t quite place.

Tears stung her eyes as she nodded reluctantly, unable to meet his gaze. "Yes," she whispered, her voice trembling.

Snape stood slowly, closing the distance between them. He stopped just behind her, his presence a mix of comfort and tension. "Look at me," he said gently.

She turned reluctantly, her cheeks flaming. When her eyes met his, she saw no ridicule, no disgust—only understanding.

"You don’t need to hide from me," he said, his voice softer now.

Her breath hitched, and for the first time in years, she felt seen—not as someone to pity or judge, but as a person. Her heart raced as she stood there, vulnerable and exposed, unsure of what to say or do next.

###

Snape's unwavering gaze held Olivia in place, his words still lingering in the charged air between them. Her heart thundered in her chest as she tried to make sense of everything that had just happened. She felt raw, vulnerable, and yet strangely… safe.

“I find it… attractive,” Snape admitted, his voice dropping to a low, rumbling whisper. His dark eyes softened ever so slightly, but the intensity in them remained. “You, Olivia. All of it. You.”

Her breath caught in her throat, and for a moment, she felt as though the world had stopped spinning. His words, so unexpected and intimate, shattered the walls she had carefully built around herself for years.

When Snape closed the gap between them again, Olivia didn’t resist. This time, she allowed herself to melt into the kiss. His lips moved against hers with surprising warmth, coaxing her to respond in kind. Her hands found their way to his chest, gripping his robes as if to steady herself. His hands, steady but firm, rested on her waist, pulling her closer.

The kiss deepened, and Olivia felt herself get lost in the moment. Their tongues met hesitantly at first, then with growing confidence, dancing in a rhythm that felt both unfamiliar and natural. She was drowning in him—in the faint scent of potions and the earthy warmth of his touch.

Her worries, her insecurities, and even the embarrassing incident moments before melted away as his arms tightened around her. But just as the kiss threatened to tip into something more, Snape pulled back, his breathing uneven, his eyes searching hers.

“Not here,” he murmured, his voice husky.

Olivia nodded, her face flushed, her lips tingling from the kiss. Neither of them spoke as he picked up her bag and handed it to her. With a silent understanding, they left his quarters, the quiet hum of their shared moment following them down the halls.

Snape walked beside her, his usually rigid posture more relaxed than she’d ever seen. They didn’t speak, but the silence between them felt full—of questions, of unspoken truths, of possibilities neither of them had dared to imagine.

When they reached her quarters, Olivia hesitated at the door, unsure of how to say goodnight.

Snape solved the dilemma for her. He turned to face her fully, his dark eyes locking onto hers. “I meant what I said,” he told her, his voice steady and deliberate. “About you. About… everything.”

Her heart fluttered, and she managed a small, shy smile. Before she could respond, Snape leaned in and kissed her one last time, a slow, lingering kiss that left her breathless.

“Goodnight, Olivia,” he said quietly, pulling away.

And just like that, he was gone, his robes billowing behind him as he disappeared down the corridor, leaving Olivia standing at her door, her head spinning and her heart pounding.

She stepped inside her quarters, leaning against the door as it clicked shut. A small, incredulous laugh escaped her lips as she touched her fingers to her mouth, still tingling from his kiss.

### Chapter 27

Olivia couldn’t get the memory of Snape kissing her out of her mind. She’d replayed the moment over and over in her head since it happened, analyzing every detail—the warmth of his lips, the surprising tenderness in his touch, the way his voice had softened when he spoke to her. It was thrilling, terrifying, and utterly consuming.

She felt on top of the world, though the sensation was bittersweet. Was this a one-time lapse in his guarded nature? Or did it mean something more?

Determined not to overthink it, she made her way to the Great Hall for dinner. Most of the staff had left for the holidays, and the castle was quieter than she’d ever known it to be. Olivia found it peaceful, though she couldn’t shake the pang of loneliness that crept in when the halls were so still.

As she entered the Great Hall, her heart skipped a beat. There he was—Snape—seated at the end of the long staff table. He seemed deep in thought, his expression as inscrutable as ever, but his eyes flicked up to meet hers as she approached.

“Miss Black,” he greeted, his tone neutral but with an edge of familiarity that made her pulse quicken.

“Professor Snape,” she replied, sliding into the seat across from him.

He closed the book he’d been reading and set it aside, his dark eyes fixed on her. “Enjoying the quiet?”

“I am,” she said, offering a small smile. “Though it’s a bit strange without the students here. Feels like the castle itself is sleeping.”

“Indeed,” he murmured. “And what are your plans for the holiday?”

She shrugged. “Staying here. Hogwarts has always felt more like home to me than anywhere else. What about you?”

“I’ve no intention of leaving,” he replied. “It seems we’ll be each other’s only company for the season.”

There was a brief pause before Snape’s lips curled into a faint smirk. “And how is it you’ve been keeping yourself occupied since our… last encounter?”

Her cheeks burned instantly. The memory of his kiss, so vivid in her mind, now hung in the air between them, charged and undeniable.

“I—I’ve been busy,” she stammered, trying to sound casual, though her voice betrayed her. “You know… lesson planning and such.”

Snape’s smirk deepened. “Ah, yes. Very industrious of you.”

Olivia’s heart raced. The way he was looking at her, the subtle amusement in his tone—it was almost too much. Butterflies erupted in her stomach, a storm of emotions she couldn’t quite name.

And then, it happened.

A familiar warmth spread through her, and panic gripped her chest. She had an accident in her pullup. Right there, sitting across from him. She shifted uncomfortably, hoping against hope that he wouldn’t notice.

But Snape noticed everything.

His dark eyes studied her with unnerving precision, and he leaned back in his chair, his smirk turning almost predatory. “Miss Black,” he said smoothly, “have you lost control?”

Her breath caught. She couldn’t bring herself to meet his gaze, but she managed a small, mortified nod.

Snape’s smirk widened. He didn’t seem disgusted or even surprised. No, there was something else in his expression—something that made her stomach flip all over again.

He leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. “You’re fascinating,” he said, his tone almost teasing but with an edge of sincerity. “I could get used to seeing you like this.”

Her eyes snapped up to his, wide with shock. She opened her mouth to respond, but no words came out. She didn’t know whether to be humiliated, angry, or… something else entirely.

Snape chuckled softly, rising from his seat. “Enjoy your evening, Miss Black,” he said, his tone as smooth as silk.

With that, he strode out of the Great Hall, leaving Olivia frozen in place, her cheeks burning and her heart pounding.

What had just happened?

###

### Chapter 28

Olivia paced back and forth in her quarters, her mind spinning in a whirlwind of emotions. After what had happened in the Great Hall, she had fled as quickly as possible, her face burning with embarrassment. She had rushed back to her room, closed the door, and leaned against it, exhaling shakily.

She opened her bag, pulling out a fresh pullup with trembling hands. Sitting on the edge of her bed, she changed quickly, trying not to linger on what had happened. But no matter how hard she tried, the memory of Snape’s words echoed in her mind.

“You’re fascinating. I could get used to seeing you like this.”

Her cheeks flushed again, and she buried her face in her hands. How could he say something like that so casually? And what did he even mean by it?

The truth was, Olivia had never met anyone who didn’t seem repelled by her condition—at least, the few people who had ever found out. She’d spent her life hiding it, ashamed of something she couldn’t control. But Snape… he wasn’t disgusted. If anything, he seemed intrigued, even drawn to her.

And she was drawn to him.

She had been since the moment she arrived back at Hogwarts. There was something about his commanding presence, his sharp intellect, and the rare glimpses of vulnerability that made her heart race. But now, that attraction was heightened by his unexpected acceptance of her secret.

It was overwhelming.

Meanwhile, in the dungeons, Snape sat at his desk, staring at a blank piece of parchment. His quill hovered in his hand, but he wasn’t focused on the lesson plan he was supposed to be writing.

Instead, his thoughts were consumed by Olivia.

He had tried to resist his feelings for her, but it was futile. There was something about her that captivated him in a way no one else ever had. She was sharp, resilient, and full of contradictions—a woman who could hold her own against him in an argument but who also harbored a vulnerability she tried so hard to conceal.

And then there was her condition.

It was unusual, yes, but he couldn’t deny the way it intrigued him. The sight of her cheeks turning pink with embarrassment, the way she tried to maintain her composure—it was fascinating. He had always been drawn to things that were hidden, things that others overlooked or dismissed. And Olivia was no exception.

He leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes. The memory of her in the Great Hall came rushing back—how her posture shifted, how her expression faltered just slightly before she nodded in acknowledgment of his question.

“Have you lost control?”

The thought sent a shiver down his spine.

Snape opened his eyes and set his quill down. He couldn’t deny it any longer. He was drawn to her, completely and utterly. And he wasn’t sure what to do about it.

Back in her quarters, Olivia lay on her bed, staring at the ceiling. She couldn’t stop thinking about him—about the way he looked at her, the way his voice softened when he spoke to her in private.

She had never been with a man before, never allowed herself to be vulnerable in that way. Her condition had always been a barrier, a wall she couldn’t imagine anyone would want to break through. But Snape… he didn’t seem to care.

A small, hopeful thought crept into her mind. What if he could accept her for who she was? What if he already had?

She shook her head, trying to push the thought away. It was too dangerous to hope for something like that. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t stop imagining what it would be like to let him in—to let him see all of her.

And for the first time in years, the thought didn’t scare her.

###

Chapter 29

Olivia sat in the dimly lit Great Hall, the flickering light from the enchanted candles casting a soft glow over the empty space. Dinner had long since ended, and the castle was eerily quiet with most of the staff away for the holidays. She had lingered longer than usual, hoping to clear her thoughts, but her solitude was interrupted by the sound of footsteps echoing through the vast room.

She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.

“Olivia,” Snape’s smooth voice drawled, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.

She tensed, unsure if she was ready for whatever conversation he was about to start. Slowly, she turned to face him, her heart pounding in her chest.

“What do you want, Professor?” she asked, trying to sound indifferent.

He smirked, stepping closer until he was standing just a few feet away from her. His dark eyes bore into hers, and she felt as though he could see every secret she tried to hide.

“I’ve been trying to focus on anything but you, and I’ve failed miserably,” he admitted, his voice low and deliberate.

Olivia’s breath hitched, her cheeks flushing. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Oh, I think you do,” Snape said, his lips curving into a faint smile. “You’ve been occupying my thoughts, Olivia. Every word you say, every glance you steal… and, yes, every time you lose control.”

Her eyes widened, and she looked away, unable to meet his gaze. “I don’t… I don’t know why you’d think about that,” she stammered, her voice barely above a whisper.

Snape stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. “Because I like it,” he said simply, his tone unwavering.

Olivia froze, her mind reeling. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “You… like it?”

He nodded, his expression softening. “There’s something… captivating about it. Watching you try so hard to maintain control, seeing the moments when you can’t—it's real. Honest. And I can’t stop thinking about it.”

Her hands trembled as she clasped them tightly in her lap. “That’s… not something people say,” she muttered, her voice breaking slightly. “Most people would find it disgusting.”

“I’m not most people,” Snape replied firmly. “And if you’ll let me, I want to prove that to you.”

Olivia hesitated, her heart racing. Every instinct told her to push him away, to protect herself from the vulnerability he was asking for. But there was another part of her—a quiet, hopeful part—that wanted to let him in.

“I don’t know if I can,” she admitted, her voice barely audible.

Snape reached out, gently tilting her chin up so that she was looking at him. “You can,” he said softly. “And I’ll be here, no matter what.”

His words broke through her walls, and she felt tears prick at her eyes. For the first time in years, she felt seen—not as a woman with a condition, but as a whole person.

“I’m scared,” she whispered.

“I know,” Snape said, his voice warm and reassuring. “But you don’t have to be. Not with me.”

Olivia swallowed hard, nodding slowly. “Okay,” she said, her voice trembling.

A small, genuine smile crossed Snape’s face, and he stepped back, giving her space. “Then let’s take this one step at a time,” he said. “No pressure, no expectations. Just… us.”

Olivia felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, she could let him in.

And for the first time, she wasn’t afraid of what might happen if she did.

### Chapter 30

Olivia paced her quarters, nervously adjusting the hem of her sweater as she glanced at the clock. Snape had invited her to his quarters again, and while the invitation was framed as professional—“to discuss the curriculum further”—she knew better. The memory of their last encounter lingered in her mind, a blend of passion and vulnerability she wasn’t sure how to navigate.

Finally, she decided she couldn’t put it off any longer. Pulling on her courage like a cloak, she left her room and headed to the dungeons.

When she reached his door, it creaked open before she could knock. Snape stood in the doorway, his usual stoic expression softening slightly when he saw her.

“Punctual as always,” he said, stepping aside to let her in.

His quarters were warm and inviting, the flicker of a fire in the hearth casting long shadows across the walls. A decanter of wine and two glasses sat on the small table near the sofa.

“Wine?” he offered, gesturing to the table.

Olivia hesitated, then nodded. “Sure.”

She sat down as he poured the wine, handing her a glass before taking a seat beside her. They sipped in silence for a moment, the air between them thick with unspoken words.

“I’ve been thinking about you,” Snape admitted finally, breaking the silence.

Olivia blushed, her heart fluttering. “I… I’ve been thinking about you too,” she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper.

Snape set his glass down and turned to face her fully. “I can’t stop,” he said, his tone low and serious. “You’ve gotten under my skin, Olivia Black.”

Her breath hitched as he leaned closer, his dark eyes locked on hers. Before she could overthink it, his lips were on hers, soft yet commanding. She melted into the kiss, her hands clutching his robes as the world around them faded away.

Heat pooled in her stomach, and before she realized what was happening, she felt the familiar warmth spreading in her pullup. Her heart sank, panic coursing through her as she pulled back from the kiss.

“Is something wrong?” Snape asked, his voice tinged with concern.

She looked away, her cheeks burning. “I… I had an accident,” she admitted shakily.

Snape’s expression shifted, and he studied her intently. “Did you?” he asked, his voice low and curious.

Olivia nodded, unable to meet his gaze.

To her surprise, Snape reached out, his fingers brushing against her cheek. “May I…?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

She looked at him, her heart pounding. “You want to… feel it?” she asked, her voice trembling.

He nodded, his gaze unwavering. “Only if you’re comfortable.”

Her mind raced, a mix of embarrassment and excitement swirling inside her. Finally, she gave a small, shaky nod. “Okay.”

Snape’s hand moved slowly, resting on her thigh for a moment before sliding down to the edge of her pullup. His touch was gentle, almost reverent, as if he was afraid to startle her. When his fingers brushed against the soft, damp material, Olivia shivered, her breathing unsteady.

“Fascinating,” he murmured, his voice filled with something she couldn’t quite place.

She closed her eyes, overwhelmed by the intimacy of the moment. “You don’t… think it’s disgusting?” she asked, her voice barely audible.

“Not at all,” he said firmly, his hand lingering for a moment before he pulled away. “In fact, I find it… compelling.”

Her cheeks burned as she opened her eyes to look at him. “You’re serious?”

“Completely,” he replied, his dark eyes locking onto hers. “You intrigue me, Olivia. Every part of you.”

She didn’t know what to say, so she leaned forward and kissed him again, her heart soaring as he pulled her closer.

Olivia pulled back from the kiss, her cheeks flushed and her breathing uneven. The intimacy of the moment was almost too much, the vulnerability of letting him know about her condition still fresh and raw.

“I need to… excuse myself,” she murmured, avoiding his gaze.

Snape nodded, his usual sharpness softened by a rare tenderness. “Go ahead,” he said, his voice low but understanding.

Olivia stood, her legs slightly unsteady beneath her, and retreated to his bathroom. Once inside, she let out a shaky breath and quickly changed into a fresh pullup from the spare she always carried in her small bag. The damp one was tucked away in a discreet pouch she kept for emergencies.

When she returned to the sitting area, she hesitated for a moment before reclaiming her seat beside him. She felt her cheeks warm again, but Snape made no comment, simply watching her with an unreadable expression.

“I’m sorry,” she said softly, breaking the silence. “I didn’t mean for… any of this to happen tonight.”

He tilted his head slightly, his dark eyes boring into hers. “You apologize too much, Olivia,” he said. “There’s nothing to be sorry for.”

Her heart fluttered at his words, and she couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at her lips. “You’re very… surprising, you know,” she said, glancing at him through her lashes.

His lips quirked into a smirk. “I could say the same about you.”

She laughed softly, the sound easing some of the lingering tension between them. But before she could overthink it, Snape leaned in and kissed her again, his hand cupping her cheek. This kiss was deeper, more deliberate, as if he was trying to convey something words couldn’t.

When they finally broke apart, Snape rested his forehead against hers, his voice barely above a whisper. “You make me feel crazy, Olivia.”

Her heart skipped a beat. “Crazy?” she repeated, her voice trembling.

He pulled back slightly, his gaze steady and intense. “Yes. Crazy enough to want this… whatever this is. To want you. And I don’t care how unorthodox it might seem.”

She stared at him, her mind racing. “You’re serious?”

“Entirely,” he said firmly. “I’m not one to mince words, Olivia. I want you in my life, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to make this work. If you’ll have me.”

Her breath caught in her throat. “I’ve never… I’ve never been in a relationship before,” she admitted, her voice barely audible.

Snape’s expression softened. “Then we’ll figure it out together,” he said simply.

Tears pricked her eyes, but she blinked them away, nodding. “Okay,” she said, her voice steady despite the whirlwind of emotions inside her.

“Okay,” he echoed, his lips curving into the faintest of smiles.

They sat there for a moment, the weight of their decision settling over them. Olivia couldn’t help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness at the idea of being with him. But for the first time in a long time, she felt hopeful.

As the fire crackled softly in the background, Snape reached for her hand, lacing his fingers with hers. And in that quiet moment, everything else seemed to fade away.

###

### Chapter 31

The days following their quiet agreement to be in a relationship were unlike anything Olivia had ever experienced. Snape, despite his intimidating exterior and cutting words with others, seemed to have an entirely different side reserved just for her. He was protective, understanding, and above all, patient—something she never imagined he was capable of.

At first, Olivia struggled to adjust. She was so used to keeping her guard up, so used to hiding parts of herself, that letting someone in—especially someone like Snape—felt almost impossible. But he had a way of putting her at ease without saying much at all.

One afternoon, they were seated together in his quarters, going over lesson plans. Olivia was perched cross-legged on the sofa, quill in hand, while Snape sat across from her, his sharp eyes scanning a stack of parchment. Despite the quiet focus in the room, she couldn’t help herself from making snarky little remarks about some of the more ridiculous answers they’d received from their students’ assignments.

“Honestly,” she said, holding up one particularly messy essay. “This one wrote a whole paragraph on why Polyjuice Potion should taste like chocolate. Chocolate! As if the effects weren’t horrifying enough without imagining yourself as dessert.”

Snape raised an eyebrow, his lips twitching. “A potion’s efficacy is hardly determined by its flavor,” he said dryly.

“I know,” Olivia said, waving the essay in the air. “But can you imagine? ‘Yes, I turned into a terrifying hybrid of human and cat, but at least it was delicious.’”

She laughed at her own joke—loudly, unabashedly, and in a way that echoed off the stone walls of his quarters. It was a genuine, unrestrained laugh, the kind she hadn’t allowed herself to feel in years. But as soon as the sound left her, she clamped her hand over her mouth, her cheeks burning.

“Sorry,” she mumbled, lowering her hand. “I didn’t mean to—”

“Don’t apologize,” Snape interrupted, his tone firm but soft.

She looked at him, startled.

“It’s... adorable,” he added after a pause, his voice quieter now, as though the word had been difficult for him to say aloud.

Her eyes widened, and she felt her face heat even more. “Adorable?” she repeated, incredulous.

He shifted slightly in his seat, clearly uncomfortable under her scrutiny. “Yes,” he said, his tone clipped but genuine. “Your laugh. It’s... endearing.”

For a moment, Olivia simply stared at him, her heart pounding. And then, to her own surprise, she laughed again—not as loudly this time, but just as freely.

“You’re full of surprises, Severus,” she said, grinning at him.

He gave her a pointed look, but the corner of his mouth twitched again, betraying his amusement. “Don’t push your luck, Black.”

The rest of the afternoon passed in a comfortable rhythm. Olivia felt more at ease with him than ever before, teasing him lightly and laughing at his dry retorts. It was a side of herself she hadn’t shown in a long time—a side she thought she’d lost somewhere along the way.

As they finished their work, Olivia realized something that made her heart ache in the best possible way. With Snape, she could be herself—completely, unapologetically herself—and he not only accepted her but seemed to cherish the very things she once thought she had to hide.

When she left his quarters that evening, she found herself smiling all the way back to her own.

###

*016*2025-02-07 14:49

### Chapter 32

It was a rare evening at Hogwarts. Snow fell gently outside, blanketing the castle grounds in shimmering white. The crackling fire in Severus’s quarters painted the walls with warm, flickering light. Olivia sat cross-legged on the rug in front of the hearth, her red curls gleaming in the firelight. Snape sat across from her, a glass of firewhiskey in hand, his usually stern expression softened.

“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” Olivia said, swirling her own glass, “but I think tonight might be the first time I’ve felt completely... normal in years.”

Snape tilted his head, his black eyes studying her. “Normal?”

“Yeah,” she said, leaning back on her hands. “No walls, no masks, no carefully rehearsed responses. Just... me. It’s terrifying, but also kind of nice.”

“You’re not alone in that,” he admitted quietly, his voice carrying a rare vulnerability.

Olivia blinked, surprised. “Severus Snape admitting he’s human? Someone alert the Prophet.”

He gave her a mock glare, but it lacked any real bite. “Careful, Black. You’re on thin ice.”

“Oh, please,” she teased, taking a sip of her drink. “If I haven’t been expelled from your company after all my sass, I think I’m safe.”

He smirked, swirling his firewhiskey. “Don’t test me.”

The evening unfolded in a way neither of them had anticipated. They talked about everything—past regrets, dreams they’d long since buried, even moments of humor they’d never shared with anyone. Snape admitted to accidentally dyeing his hair green during his first attempt at an advanced potion as a student. Olivia confessed she’d once turned her dormmate’s hair blue after a particularly nasty argument.

“You?” Snape asked, raising an eyebrow. “A hair-dyeing hex? How very Gryffindor of you.”

“Oh, shut it,” Olivia said, tossing a cushion at him. “She deserved it.”

Snape caught the cushion with a quick flick of his hand, his lips quirking into a rare smile. “I’m sure she did.”

As the hours passed, their laughter grew louder and more unrestrained. Olivia felt a lightness in her chest she hadn’t felt in years. She was laughing so hard at Snape’s sarcastic recounting of a ridiculous first-year duel he’d overseen that she clutched her sides, gasping for air.

And then it happened.

A familiar warmth spread through her pullup, and she froze for a split second, the realization hitting her. But instead of the usual panic or embarrassment, she just... kept laughing. It was too absurd, too ridiculous to care about.

Snape noticed her hesitation and tilted his head. “Something wrong?”

Through her laughter, Olivia managed to shake her head. “No... no, it’s nothing.”

He raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced, but as she laughed harder, the corners of his mouth twitched.

“Did you—?” he started, but Olivia cut him off.

“Don’t say it!” she gasped between laughs. “Just don’t!”

That did it. Snape actually laughed—deep, genuine, and warm, a sound she’d never heard from him before. It made her laugh even harder, tears streaming down her face.

“You’re unbelievable,” he said, his voice laced with amusement as he shook his head.

“And you’re laughing!” she shot back, pointing at him.

“I’m laughing *at* you,” he clarified, though the glint in his eyes betrayed him.

“Oh, sure,” Olivia said, wiping her eyes. “Whatever you say, Severus”

The warmth of the moment settled over them like a blanket. Olivia leaned back, her laughter fading into soft chuckles. Snape, for his part, was still smirking, his dark eyes fixed on her with an intensity that made her stomach flutter.

“You’re remarkable, you know that?” he said suddenly, his voice low.

Olivia blinked, her heart skipping a beat. “Remarkable? For laughing so hard I... well, you know?”

“For being entirely yourself,” he said, his gaze unwavering. “It’s rare.”

Her cheeks flushed, and she looked away, suddenly shy. “Well, you bring it out in me.”

The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. For once, Snape didn’t deflect or retreat behind his usual sharp wit. Instead, he reached out, his hand brushing hers.

“I could get used to this,” he said softly.

Olivia smiled, her heart full. “Me too.”

As the fire crackled and the snow fell outside, they sat together, the weight of the past melting away in the warmth of newfound companionship.

### Chapter 33

The morning light filtered through the tall, arched windows of Severus Snape’s quarters, casting a soft glow over the room. Olivia blinked herself awake, the comforting warmth of the fire long since faded but replaced by something else—someone else. She was curled up against Severus on the couch, her head resting on his chest, his arm draped protectively around her shoulders.

For a moment, she didn’t move. She didn’t want to. The steady rise and fall of his chest beneath her and the faint scent of sandalwood and herbs that clung to him made her feel safe in a way she hadn’t felt in years. She closed her eyes, savoring the moment, until a sudden realization hit her.

Her pullup.

She shifted slightly and felt the all-too-familiar dampness. A wave of embarrassment washed over her as she carefully untangled herself from Severus’s arm. He stirred slightly but didn’t wake, his lips parting just enough for her to notice how peaceful he looked when he wasn’t scowling.

Tiptoeing out of the room, Olivia made her way to the small adjoining bathroom. She sighed as she closed the door, leaning against it for a moment to collect herself. She peeled off the wet pullup, cleaned herself up, and changed into a fresh one.

Staring at her reflection in the mirror, Olivia found herself smiling despite the usual embarrassment. Snape hadn’t pushed her last night. He hadn’t tried to make the evening into something more than what it was—a night of closeness, of laughter, and unspoken understanding. For all his sharp edges, he’d shown her more tenderness than she ever thought he was capable of.

When she returned to the living area, Severus was awake, sitting upright on the couch. His dark eyes immediately found hers, soft and searching.

“Good morning,” he said in that deep, smooth voice that always sent a little shiver down her spine.

“Morning,” she replied, tucking a stray curl behind her ear as she sat down beside him.

“You left rather abruptly,” he noted, his tone gentle but curious.

Olivia hesitated, then decided to be honest. “I... needed to freshen up.”

Understanding flickered in his expression, and he nodded. “You don’t have to explain.”

“I just...” She bit her lip, glancing at him. “I really appreciate how patient you’ve been. I’m not... I mean, I’ve never...”

“Been in a relationship before,” he finished for her, his voice calm and steady.

She nodded, her cheeks flushing. “Yeah. And last time, when you... well, when you touched my pullup—it felt like a lot. Not in a bad way,” she added quickly. “Just... I’m not ready for anything more yet.”

Severus studied her for a moment, his gaze thoughtful. Then he reached out, gently taking her hand in his. “Olivia,” he said, his voice low, “I need you to know something. I have no intention of rushing you into anything you’re not ready for. Whatever boundaries you set, I will respect them. Always.”

Her heart swelled at his words, and she gave him a small, grateful smile. “Thank you,” she said softly.

He squeezed her hand before letting go. “And for the record,” he added, his lips twitching into the faintest smirk, “I rather enjoyed last night. I can be content with holding you as long as you’ll allow it.”

Olivia laughed, the sound light and genuine. “I think I can handle that.”

They spent the rest of the morning together, sharing quiet conversation and comfortable silences. At one point, Olivia leaned against him, and he wrapped an arm around her shoulders, pulling her close.

“This is nice,” she murmured, her head resting against his chest.

“It is,” he agreed, his voice rumbling softly.

As they sat together on the couch, Snape’s mind churned with thoughts he couldn’t quite banish. His gaze flicked to Olivia, her features softened by the warmth of the moment. The way her curls framed her face, the faint smattering of freckles across her pale cheeks—it was all endearing. But underneath that, he felt a gnawing sense of guilt.

“Olivia,” he began, his voice uncharacteristically hesitant.

She looked up at him, curious. “Yes?”

He shifted slightly, his arm tightening around her shoulders. “I’ve been thinking...” His words came slowly, measured. “And I owe you an apology.”

Her brows furrowed. “For what?”

“For asking if I could... touch your pullup,” he admitted, the words coming out in a low murmur. “It was presumptuous of me, and I didn’t consider how that might have made you feel.”

Olivia blinked, caught off guard by his sincerity. “Severus, I—”

“I should have known better,” he interrupted, his tone firm but tinged with regret. “Your condition, your inexperience—it’s clear that intimacy is something new for you. I was thoughtless, and I don’t want you to feel pressured by me. Ever.”

Her chest tightened at his words. She had been embarrassed, yes, but his willingness to acknowledge his mistake and apologize meant more to her than she could express. She placed a hand on his arm, her fingers brushing against the sleeve of his robe.

“I appreciate that,” she said softly. “I was a little uncomfortable, but it’s not just you. It’s... everything. I’ve never done anything like this before, and I guess I’m still trying to figure out where my boundaries are.”

He nodded, his dark eyes meeting hers. “You’re allowed to take all the time you need. I’ll wait as long as it takes.”

Her lips curved into a small smile. “You’re really not as intimidating as you like people to think.”

His expression softened, the corners of his mouth twitching upward. “Don’t let that get around. I have a reputation to uphold.”

She laughed, the sound light and genuine, and leaned into him again. Snape rested his chin lightly against the top of her head, his heart surprisingly full. Despite his sharp tongue and years of cynicism, Olivia was breaking down walls he hadn’t even realized he’d built.

As they sat in silence, Olivia’s mind replayed his apology over and over. She’d never felt so seen—so cared for—by anyone. And the fact that it was Severus Snape, of all people, made it all the more astonishing.

“Thank you,” she said suddenly, her voice barely above a whisper.

“For what?” he asked.

“For being... you,” she replied, tilting her head to look up at him. “For understanding me.”

He studied her for a moment, his expression unreadable. Then, with a rare tenderness, he pressed a kiss to her forehead. “You make it easy, Olivia.”

And in that moment, she believed him.

### Chapter 34

The bells of Hogwarts chimed brightly as the students returned from Christmas break, their chatter filling the castle halls with renewed energy. Olivia stood near the staff table in the Great Hall, her gaze sweeping over the familiar faces as students filed in. She had spent the break basking in the warmth of her budding relationship with Severus, and though the thought of the busy semester ahead loomed large, she felt more confident than ever.

Her confidence wavered slightly, however, when Gilderoy Lockhart strolled into the hall, a peacock feather quill tucked behind his ear and his lavender robes shimmering obnoxiously under the enchanted ceiling.

“Ah, you must be Olivia Black!” Lockhart exclaimed, sweeping toward her with a dramatic flair. He extended his hand with an exaggerated flourish, his teeth glinting in an unnaturally bright smile.

Olivia plastered on a polite smile as she shook his hand. “That’s me. And you are?”

“Gilderoy Lockhart, of course!” he announced, clearly expecting recognition. “Author, adventurer, and now your esteemed colleague.”

“Right,” she said, her tone light but tinged with sarcasm. “I think I saw one of your books in Flourish and Blotts. Something about *Gadding with Ghouls?*”

“Indeed! A bestseller!” he boasted, his chest puffing out. “I daresay my expertise will add a certain flair to the curriculum.”

Olivia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “Well, it’s always nice to have fresh perspectives,” she said diplomatically.

Lockhart beamed, clearly mistaking her politeness for admiration. “You’ll find me an endless source of inspiration, Miss Black. Perhaps I could even give you a few tips on how to captivate your students.”

“I’ll keep that in mind,” she replied dryly before excusing herself to find Severus.

Later that evening, Olivia found herself in Severus’s office, the warm glow of candlelight flickering off the stone walls. They sat across from one another, stacks of lesson plans between them, though neither was particularly focused on the papers.

“So,” Olivia began, setting her quill down. “Lockhart.”

Snape’s lip curled in disdain. “An insufferable peacock.”

Olivia laughed, covering her mouth. “I take it you two aren’t going to be best friends.”

“I’d rather brew potions with Longbottom than endure a conversation with that fool,” Snape muttered, earning another laugh from Olivia. He watched her closely, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. “Though I suspect you’ll find him equally insufferable before long.”

“He’s... a lot,” Olivia admitted. “But I’ll survive.”

Snape leaned back in his chair, his dark eyes softening as they settled on her. “Speaking of survival, have you given any thought to how we should approach... us?”

Olivia’s cheeks warmed. “You mean keeping our relationship under wraps?”

He nodded. “I’m not suggesting secrecy, but discretion. The students have a knack for turning whispers into wild tales.”

She smiled. “Agreed. I don’t need the entire school speculating about my love life.”

His gaze softened further at her use of the word “love,” though he didn’t comment on it. “We’ll keep things professional in front of others,” he said. “Though I reserve the right to glare at Lockhart if he so much as looks at you.”

Olivia smirked. “I think glaring at him is just your default setting.”

“Perhaps,” he replied, his lips twitching upward. “But I’m serious. If he crosses a line—”

“I can handle myself, Severus,” she interrupted gently. “But I appreciate your... protectiveness.”

He regarded her silently for a moment, then nodded. “Very well. But should you need me, you know where to find me.”

The warmth in his voice sent a pleasant shiver down her spine. As they returned to their lesson planning, Olivia couldn’t help but marvel at how much her life had changed. Keeping their relationship discreet would be a challenge, but with Severus by her side, she felt ready to face whatever the semester had in store.
