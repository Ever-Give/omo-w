I found some interesting stories on 'archive of our own'. Never read them before and maybe other people haven't read them either. They're worth it; especially the Sherlock Holmes' ones are great.

And here's one of these great stories:

Aw, thank you Ranma! I am glad you and the others like it.

I will open a new topic (or dig up an old topic) to post some other links, but then dedicated to Harry Potter.

As for now, have I posted this story already?

Thank you for adding these two stories! I especially liked the first one!
