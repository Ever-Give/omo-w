I still have a few chapters written out, så here's another instalment.

There's explicit sex in this one, too, and probably in all the chapters going forward... 😈

Chapter 5: A covert thrill

“You know, I would’ve pissed my pants way sooner if I had known that would be the end result,” Johnny said, after they had both showered and were cuddled up in bed.

“I really like this take-charge side of you.”

June blushed and hid her face against his chest.

“Did you like it?” she asked him. “The wetting part, I mean,” she clarified.

Johnny thought for a moment.

“To be honest, I don’t know,” he said. “I definitely did not care for the panic and pain. It hurt so much, and I was trying so hard to not piss my pants. I had no intention of pissing myself,” he admitted. “The intention was just to make myself have to go really bad, to see if it did anything for me. I had every intention of making it to the toilet. I was really bursting when we left the movie theater, but I still thought I had everything under control. In the car, though, it started to really hurt, and I started to get really concerned I was going to lose it and piss all over myself and my car seat. I don’t think I’ve ever been happier to see your house!”

He chuckled softly and kissed the top of her head, where it rested on his shoulder.

“I really thought I was going to make it, but then my bladder just sort of… spasmed, and piss just started coming out. I couldn’t stop it! It came out slow at first, but then it just started gushing, and I had no control over it. I panicked! I flat out panicked, and I fumbled so much with my buttons, I thought I would never get my pants down. I could feel it soaking into my boxers and run down my leg. I was like a hose that had sprung a leak! It kept coming out as I fished my cock out, and I pissed all over my hand, but I finally got it out, and your flower bed was the best option. It felt fucking amazing to finally relax and let go, though!”

He smiled, and June kissed his neck, just underneath his ear.

“When I was finally empty,” he continued. “I was so embarrassed. Fuck! You have no idea… I could feel you standing there beside me, you know, watching me. You had seen everything! I felt like an absolute fool for losing control like that. I was almost afraid to lift my eyes and look at you, I was so ashamed. But then you… you amazing woman… your eyes just lit up and you smiled… and I think I tried to explain myself, you know, I was rambling, and then you just… kissed me.”

He smiled again, pulling her closer to him.

“You just shut me up with a kiss, and then you touched the spot where I had pissed in my pants, and I just… I felt you wanting me, and I wanted you, and I got hard, and… fuck! I don’t know, I didn't feel so embarrassed anymore. Instead it felt… exciting, I don't know. Maybe I was still high on the relief, but I didn't mind the wetness so much when I could see you clearly didn’t mind. I don’t know, I might try it again sometime when I’m in control.”

“Fuck, yes! Please…” June murmured against his neck.

Johnny grinned and rolled on top of her, kissing her deeply.

***

That summer was the best June had ever known. She and Johnny grew really close, and they experimented with wetting in private. Johnny concluded he didn’t really get turned on by wetting himself, but he didn’t mind it at all, and it never failed to get June all hot and bothered when he did. That was something he did get turned on by, so he was happy to join in every now and then. He also got turned on by June indulging, whether it be light holding in public, where June whispered in his ear that she had to pee and put on a discrete show of crossing or jiggling her legs, or the occasional wetting in private, where she could be more explicit about it. It wasn’t so much the wetting itself that turned him on, he had confided in her, but Johnny knew how much it turned June on, and therefore both holding and wetting were extremely sexy to him. He had told her he liked that she trusted him enough to share her authentic self with him. That was what he found sexy.

June thrived. She didn’t feel like she had to hide part of herself away anymore. From everybody else, sure, she didn’t want anyone else knowing her private business, but she could be herself with Johnny, in a way she had never been able to be fully herself with anyone. Recently, she had started thinking about trying something new. Growing up, societal norms had instilled in her the idea that to wet herself was to have an “accident”. Her explorations with Johnny had severed this connection in her head. She didn’t have to have an accident, pretend or otherwise! 

There was no need to hold until she couldn’t anymore. In fact, she preferred when she didn’t. Deliberately letting her pee gush into her pants at the place and moment of her choosing was an incredibly erotic act for her, and now she was wondering if there was some way of doing that in public, but in such a way that nobody would know what she had done. She figured that would be the ultimate thrill, the ultimate breaking of a taboo: She didn’t lose control in an accident, she deliberately flouted convention and propriety.

One Saturday evening in early August, June and Johnny were at a barbecue party with some friends. June had had a couple of wine coolers and was feeling adventurous. People had started talking about going out to a club, but that was not at all what June had in mind.

She found Johnny in the kitchen, talking to a mutual acquaintance of theirs. The music was really loud, so June just raised her chin in greeting. Then she leaned in close against Johnny, kissed his neck and whispered huskily in his ear.

“I really have to pee, and I want to have some fun. Let’s get out of here. Meet me outside in five minutes and walk home with me?”

She felt Johnny stiffen briefly beside her and knew he understood what she meant. His eyes glittered and he cocked an eyebrow at her as she kissed him lightly on the lips and walked away again to go say goodbye to her friends.

It was a nice late summer evening, and June was wearing a floaty, floral dress with spaghetti straps and a flared skirt that ended at mid-thigh. She didn’t trust this dress in the wind, however, so she was also wearing bike shorts underneath. A light cardigan was enough to keep her warm.

The walk back to her flat wasn’t super long, but it was made much longer by Johnny constantly pressing her up against fences and lampposts to kiss her.

June was getting increasingly turned on. It was a nice, balmy evening, her boyfriend was hot, her bladder was pleasantly full, and the alcohol in her system made her feel reckless.

“So you have to pee, huh?” Johnny asked teasingly as he pulled her close and kissed her again. He was also a little tipsy, it seemed. “How bad is it? Can you hold it?”

June was so aroused, she moaned into his kiss.

“I can hold it,” she said. “But I don’t want to.”

“Is that so?” Johnny said with a wicked grin as they started walking again.

June shot a glance at their surroundings. Nobody around. They were alone.

“Yeah,” June said. Her bladder was starting to feel really full, and she longed to let some out.

“I might wet myself,” she continued, with a mock serious look on her face. And then she giggled. She leaned against the next lamppost and pulled Johnny close for a kiss.

“No kidding,” Johnny said against her mouth, still grinning. “Can I feel?”

June could feel his erection press against her lower abdomen, where it was straining against the fly of his pants. Without breaking the kiss, she pulled her lower body slightly away from him and guided his hand up the front of her dress. He stroked her swollen clit gently through her bike shorts, and June moaned. Without giving herself time to think too hard about what she was doing, she relaxed and released a powerful spurt of pee into her underwear.

Johnny drew in a sharp breath, but did not remove his hand or break their kiss. June could feel the wet flood soak into her underwear and bike shorts, warming her entire crotch area. It seeped down the inside thighs of her bike shorts, but she did not stop it until she could feel it start to run down her bare legs.

She pulled away from Johnny and looked down. The rivulets down her legs continued for a few seconds longer, and there was a noticeable wet spot on the pavement between her feet.

“Oops?” June said, mischievously, as she looked back up at Johnny, her heart hammering. She had done it! She had peed her pants in public! What a thrill!

“Daring!” Johnny said, smirking, and with a cocked eyebrow. His eyes glittered at her as he casually wiped his wet hand on his pants, and they started walking again.

“I know,” June said, still breathless. “I figured with the dress… you can’t really see it… Fuck! What a thrill! My heart is beating so fast!”

They turned a corner and noticed a figure up ahead, walking in their direction on the sidewalk. None of them said anything until the guy had passed them and continued on his way, but June was freaking out. She was flat-out panicking.

“Holy fuck, I wet myself in public! Why didn’t you remind me there are other PEOPLE in public!?” June panic-whispered to Johnny when she was sure the guy was far enough behind them that he would not overhear. “My pants are soaking wet right now, and that guy was just feet away from me! He looked at my legs, too! What if he could tell?! My legs are wet! My SHOES are wet!”

“Relax,” Johnny said quietly, grinning at her. “Of course he looked at your legs, you look fucking hot in that dress! But unless you plan on lifting your skirt up and showing people your wet underwear, nobody can see anything.”

“But I know…” he teased, his devilish grin back on his face. “You’ve been naughty!”

She grinned back.

They walked in silence for a couple of minutes, and June was getting more and more turned on by the wetness of her bike shorts against her skin.

After checking once more that there was nobody else around, June stopped walking and turned to Johnny, pulling him in for another kiss.

“I am so turned on right now!” she said. “I can’t wait to get home so I can get you inside me.”

She kissed him deeply and touched the front of his pants, where his erection strained at his fly. He moaned quietly. Feeling extremely aroused, June relaxed and let her pee flow freely into her pants for several seconds.

“I’m peeing,” she said huskily, in between kisses, and Johnny drew a sharp breath. Her entire crotch warmed under the flow, and her sensitive clit throbbed in response to the tickling torrent. Her already saturated bike shorts could not absorb the sudden deluge, which rushed down the inseam of her shorts before it cascaded down her bare legs and splashed noisily on the ground between her feet.

June could not help but moan quietly before she broke off the kiss and her stream, and stepped away from the unmistakable puddle, pulling Johnny along.

By the time they made it to June’s flat, they were all over each other. Johnny took her cardigan off before they even got in the door. June peeled off her underwear and bike shorts, both soaking wet and cold, and threw them on the floor, but she kept her dress on. Johnny unbuttoned his shorts and pulled his boxer briefs down a little, but did not take them off all the way. He unbuttoned his shirt and let it hang open, but he did not take it off. He sat down on her desk chair and beckoned with his finger for her to join him. June realized what he was doing. He was going to let her get his clothes all wet when she inevitably let herself go, and she went absolutely feral with arousal.

“Come ride me, sexy,” he said, his eyes near black with lust. “Don’t hold back, I want you wet.”

By the time she had lowered herself onto his lap, facing the wrong way round on the chair, he was already hard underneath her. She guided him into position and moaned with pleasure as she took the entire length of him into her. He gripped her ass firmly with both hands under her dress.

“Fuck, yes, that’s it!” she breathed. “I’m already close, babe, I’ve been turned on all night thinking about what I was going to do, dying to feel you inside me.”

She rode him slowly up and down, gyrating her hips.

“Oh, Jesus, fuck, you feel good!” Johnny moaned. “I’ve been hard ever since you pissed on my hand back there. Fucking hell, that was a bold move! It turned you on, didn’t it? I know it did. You dirty girl you! And that turns me on. God, I love it when you initiate!”

June could only moan in response. Her breathing quickened and she was on the verge of coming already.

“Don’t hold back!” Johnny said breathily, grabbing her ass tighter as he thrusted deeper into her. “Let yourself go! It’s so fucking hot when you unleash yourself on me!”

June raised herself up on his cock, before lowering herself again slowly, looking straight into his eyes as she relaxed. Johnny gasped when the hot pee hit his lower abdomen and splashed everywhere, soaking into their clothes and forming a puddle on the floor, but he held her gaze and moved his hips to thrust deep into her.

June moaned as her orgasm took her. Her pee became a roaring torrent before slowing to a mere trickle, and her pussy contracted and pulsed around Johnny’s cock. Awash in hormones and severely blissed out, she was vaguely aware of him increasing his frequency before spilling inside her.

After taking a few seconds to just breathe, she opened her eyes and met Johnny’s gaze.

“That was fucking amazing,” he said. “The whole thing. I can’t believe you fucking peed on my hand in public!”

They both laughed.

“Well, you asked if you could feel!” June said. “It’s your own damn fault!”

She looked around at where they sat.

“Shame about the mess, though…”

There was, indeed, a mess. The skirt of her dress was wet, Johnny’s pants and shirttails were wet, and there was even a wet handprint on Johnny’s shirt near the shoulder. June assumed she had put her hand in the way of her stream at some point, before grabbing on to him. And last, but not least, there was a giant puddle on the floor.

“Worth it,” Johnny said, and kissed her. “You’re so sexy when you let everything go like that. Free and uninhibited. The clean-up is totally worth it.”

Chapter 6: A daring adventure

A week or so later, June came home to a wrapped present waiting for her on the kitchen table.

“What’s this?” she asked Johnny. “It’s not my birthday?”

“I know,” Johnny said. “This is really a present for both of us.”

His eyes glittered as she unwrapped it, but June was confused about the giant sheet of plaid fabric that was inside. It was enormous, and she had no idea what it was.

“Technically, it’s a picnic blanket,” Johnny said. “But we’re not going on a picnic.”

June just raised her eyebrows, still confused.

“Look, the back is waterproof,” Johnny said. “I’m tired of hard surfaces and sharp corners poking me when we’re … having fun…” His voice trailed off and he smirked.

June’s face lit up, as the penny finally dropped.

“So… we can… let loose…” She grinned. “And it won’t ruin the mattress? And we won’t even have to change the sheets?”

“That’s the idea,” Johnny replied, grinning back.

***

A couple of days later, June was running errands in town. It was a dreary day, and she was wearing her old raincoat that came down almost to her knees, over a pair of black corduroy pants. Her mind was filled with fantasies of what she wanted to do with Johnny on the picnic blanket, which they had yet to try out, when she felt the first twinges of her bladder filling up. Firmly entrenched in a wetting mindset, June’s first instinct had been to just relax and let it flow. She was so turned on already, thinking about the endless opportunities her new blanket represented, that the pee was already at the opening, about to come out, before she realized where she was and what she was doing.

She gasped and clamped her muscles tight, pulling the pee back up into her bladder. What the hell was that? Was she out of her fucking mind!?! She furtively looked around. Nobody seemed to have noticed her gasp or little curtsy to stop herself from peeing.

The thought niggled, though… What if she did let some pee out? Her pants were black. She was wearing a long raincoat. In theory… nobody would have any idea…

June’s heart was racing. Was she actually considering this? She, who had previously been all about stealth and secrecy, about eliminating all risks of public exposure, was actually considering wetting her pants in broad daylight? In town, with lots of people around?

She was. Yes. She was, in fact, considering it.

As she completed the rest of her errands, it was all she could think about. Her bladder was also filling up, and she was now at that stage that never failed to get her arousal up. The need was insistent, with a constant pressure, but she was not yet in any pain or afraid she might not be able to hold it.

Her new mobile phone beeped in her pocket. Her parents had bought it for her; they were getting tired of trying to reach her through her landlady and wanted to be able to call her whenever they wanted. It was a Nokia 3210, and June loved it. Text messages were fast becoming her favorite way to communicate, and she and Johnny were constantly texting each other when they weren’t together.

She pulled her phone out and saw she had a text message from Johnny.

What do u want 4 dinner?

He was coming over that afternoon, like most afternoons, and he had promised to make her dinner. June texted back:

Don’t know

But then an idea occurred to her, and her stomach did that swoopy thing. She smiled.

How about a picnic? 😛

Then she sent a picture message of an umbrella, and added:

We might get wet tho…

June’s phone instantly blew up with text messages from Johnny, demanding to know what she was up to. June just sent a winky-face back to him and did not elaborate.

Right. She was doing this, then. Was she? Was she really doing it?

June took a deep breath, but her heart kept racing, beating away like a jackhammer inside her chest. Her sex already throbbed with arousal, and she could feel herself getting wet.

Her errands completed, June found her stop and pretended to read the bus schedule, even though she knew perfectly well her bus was scheduled to arrive in five minutes. Without giving herself time to reconsider, she stood with her legs hip-width apart and relaxed her muscles. Pee immediately trickled into her underwear, which, to be fair, was already pretty wet from her arousal, and June had to suppress a gasp as the hot wetness bloomed across her crotch, expanding forward and backward, soaking into her corduroy pants.

Quickly, she pinched off the flow. Fuck! What had she done? Was she insane?!

Without any alcohol in her system, like last time, June had a moment of panic. She forced herself to take a deep breath and think rationally about it. Nobody could see anything. Her coat covered her almost to the knees, and her pants were black. A casual glance down told her there were no drops on the ground, and she had not felt anything run down her legs. Her secret was safe.

June’s bus came, and she got on it. Thankfully, it was full enough that her choosing to stand would not seem odd. It wasn’t like she could sit down in wet pants! Despite her earlier panic, June could not suppress a little smile. She had just peed her pants! In public! In broad daylight! The wetness was rapidly cooling, and as she swayed with the movements of the bus navigating traffic, she could feel the wet fabric cling to her skin. It was incredibly arousing, and June could feel her cheeks heat slightly. She still had to pee, but she didn’t dare let any more out while on the bus. What if some drops fell on the floor? Not only would she be mortified if anyone saw anything, but it would also feel like vandalism somehow. She didn’t want anyone else to have to clean up after her.

Her stop was just a few minutes’ walk from her flat, and she was the only one who got off there. A quick glance around told her there were nobody else around either. “Yet another perk of living outside the city center,” June thought to herself.

With her pulse racing yet again, she relaxed and let another gush of pee soak into her pants for a couple of seconds. Her already sodden underwear could not contain it all, and she could feel the wetness soak into her pants, making its way down the inside of her thighs. To her horror, she felt a rivulet of pee snake its way down her entire leg and soak into her sock. Gasping, she pressed her legs together. Oh, no! Too much! She had let out too much! What if her pants showed a visible wet streak down her leg below her coat?!

With her heart hammering, June bent down and pretended to scratch an itch on her knee. Discretely, she inspected the damage. Nothing. She breathed a sigh of relief. Thank God.

She had gotten away with it. Grinning to herself, she straightened and started walking the short distance to her flat, arousal building with every step.

Johnny was waiting at the door when she arrived, leaning on the door frame.

“A picnic, eh?” he said, eyes glittering. “Did someone have fun in town today?”

He watched her closely as she removed her raincoat and hung it up.

“I might have…” June said, blushing as she toed her shoes off and put them away.

“I had to pee, you see, and then I remembered that I was wearing a long coat and black pants, and… well, I… was a little naughty…”

Johnny just moved in and kissed her. Over his shoulder, June could see into the combined living room and bedroom. The picnic blanket was already spread out across the big bed, covering everything. Johnny pulled her toward it, still kissing her.

“You’re fucking bold, and I love it!” Johnny said against her lips.

“Your god damn text messages, I was going out of my mind, imagining how turned on you were making yourself out there, on your way home to me.”

He unbuttoned her pants and put his hand into her sodden underwear, finding her clit. June gasped and thrust her hips against his hand.

“Ooh, you’re really wet, aren’t you, in more ways than one…” he chuckled. “Fuck, you’re hot!”

He pulled off her pants and underwear, as well as his own, freeing his impressive erection from its restrictive prison. June moaned as Johnny pushed her down on the bed, on top of the picnic blanket. She spread her legs, inviting Johnny in, and he quickly guided himself into position with a moan of his own.

“Fuck! You feel so good!” he mumbled, as he thrust into her.

June gasped as she felt the fullness of him. The added pressure on her bladder was exquisite torture, and she moaned as she gave into it, releasing a short spurt of pee onto them both.

“Oops…” she said against Johnny’s neck. Perhaps she should have warned him, but she figured he knew what he was getting himself into with the blanket on the bed.

“Naughty, naughty…”

Johnny just grinned at her, eyes glittering. They kissed again, deeply, and Johnny continued moving his cock in and out of her in a slow and steady rhythm.

“I’m already close, baby,” June breathed. “I am so close! You feel so good in me!”

Her arousal spiked, and she relaxed again, letting another gushing spurt of pee escape. She could feel the warm wetness start to pool under her butt.

Johnny moaned. “Don’t hold back, sexy! Let’s see what this blanket is good for!”

June could feel her muscles begin to tighten as her orgasm approached. She hooked her legs around Johnny’s waist and let go of her bladder muscles. A torrent of pee shot out of her, hissing, and as she felt her bladder empty with increasing relief, she came hard.

Afterwards, when Johnny had rolled off her and they were lying side by side, both breathing heavily, June became aware of the fact that she was lying in an actual puddle.

The wetness extended halfway up her back, too, and a good way down her thighs, but under her butt was an actual puddle of her pee.

She started to laugh softly. Johnny raised his head and just looked at her.

“A puddle!” she laughed. “I made a puddle! I used to worry about other people knowing even my thoughts, and now I made an actual PUDDLE on my bed with you in it!”

Johnny rolled back to face her and kissed her softly.

“I love you,” he said.

“I love you,” June said.

(Here's a couple more chapters. Ch. 7 is short, but sweet, whereas ch. 8 is a little bit longer. CW: There is some diaper use for convenience in that one. I have not ever personally used/purchased diapers, so I have no idea about their capacity or what would have been available for purchase in 1999. If I'm way off, please suspend your disbelief for that part, lol.) Chapter 7: A trip to the beach

Late August offered up some lovely weather, and June and Johnny decided to go to the beach. This could very well be their last opportunity this season, with courses starting up again soon.

Secretly, June was excited for fall this year. With the new direction her life had taken, she planned to make the most of the months ahead, wearing long coats at every opportunity…

She couldn’t get her adventure in town out of her head. Looking back, she didn’t get any of the panic and fear she had felt in the moment — all she could remember was the excitement and arousal at the wetness blooming in her pants. In public!

There were lots of people at the beach, but none of them were really close to her and Johnny. They had chosen to set up their little beach chairs a little bit off to the side. After swimming for a while, they were now lounging, warming up in the sun.

“I can’t stop thinking about it,” June said quietly to Johnny.

“About what?” Johnny said.

“The day in town when I *wet* myself,” June said, whispering the word wet. “And then what we did after…”

Johnny cocked an eyebrow at her in response.

“It’s turning me on,” June admitted, blushing, but her eyes glittered at Johnny.

“I kinda want to do it again…”

Johnny didn’t immediately answer, but casually folded his hands across his lap where he sat, hiding the bulge June’s words had created.

“Easy!” he said to June at last. “I’ll be arrested for indecency!”

She grinned at him.

“Now that you mention it, though…” he continued, quietly, so nobody would overhear.

“A thought occurred to me. I actually have to piss pretty bad right now. I was going to ask you to come swimming with me, to feel me warm up the water a little, but… what if I just go right here?”

June whipped around to look at him. She could not believe what she was hearing.

“You mean… in your shorts?” She took a deep breath. “On the chair?”

Johnny nodded. Then he winked at her.

June was so aroused that she had to squeeze her legs together. She wanted to touch herself, but didn’t dare with so many people around. Was he serious?

Johnny adjusted himself through his shorts. He didn’t say anything, but held up a finger, as if to tell her to wait.

“Ok,” he said finally. “I’m ready.”

He rested his hands on the armrests of the low beach chair and leaned his head back, closing his eyes. June quickly glanced around. Nobody was paying them any attention, and Johnny just looked as if he was relaxing, enjoying the sunshine.

Suddenly, a wet spot appeared to the left of the center front seam on Johnny’s dark blue swim shorts. June gasped.

“Sssshhh,” Johnny whispered, but he did not stop.

The wet spot grew, and with Johnny leaning back so far, it seemed to pool in his lap, before it ran between his legs and pattered onto the sand below through the plastic bands making up the seat of Johnny’s low chair. Johnny kept going and going, and June watched, mesmerized, as the wet spot on his shorts glistened in the sun. After around 30 seconds, Johnny heaved a great sigh and opened his eyes again. June could see a huge wet spot on the sand underneath his chair.

“Well, that felt good,” Johnny said quietly, matter-of-factly. “I really had to go.”

Lowering his voice even further, he leaned toward June. “My entire butt is wet!”

June could not help a low whimper. She was so turned on it almost hurt.

“Fuck me, that was hot!” she whispered.

“That can be arranged,” Johnny said with a grin. “I think we’ll have to wait until we get home, though…”

June kept sneaking glances at Johnny’s wet shorts. The wicking material of his swim shorts soon erased any trace of an actual wet spot, but the knowledge of what Johnny had done was enough to keep June aroused with a single glance over at them.

“Come on, babe, are you going to let me be the only one to sit here in wet shorts…?” he asked, when June snuck another glance over at him. “Don’t you have to pee?”

June did have to pee. Her need had been building for a while now, and she had actually also been contemplating a swim when Johnny pulled his bold move. The pressure had only increased since, and she was getting close to desperate.

“I do,” she confirmed to him. “Do you mind if I copy you?”

“Not at all, babe,” he said and reached for her hand to hold it. “Go for it!”

Cheeks burning and heart racing, June spread her legs slightly in the chair and relaxed. Pee shot out of her in a strong jet, and she could feel the wetness bloom across her crotch and spread down and back, across her entire butt. It pattered where it fell on the sand underneath her chair.

Johnny drew in a sharp breath and squeezed her hand, but didn’t say anything.

June also did not say anything, but leaned her head back and enjoyed the relief. She peed for what felt like forever, but it was probably only around 30 seconds.

When her stream finally slowed and then stopped, she opened her eyes and met Johnny’s gaze. His eyes glittered and he smiled at her.

“Good?” he said.

“Amazing!” June responded. In a whisper, she added: “Fuck! I’m so turned on right now!”

Johnny said nothing, but casually folded his hands in his lap again. He grinned at her.

Chapter 8: A happy Halloween

Fall came and June’s life continued to be amazing. She and Johnny had decided to formally move in together, as they were spending virtually all their time together anyway, and Johnny was desperate to get away from his roommates.

With their combined rent-paying ability, they were able to find a cute one-bedroom not far from June’s old studio.

Their respective studies were still demanding a lot from them both, but it was lovely to have Johnny around every day (and night). The new flat was also within walking distance from campus, and June enjoyed the fresh air on her walk back and forth each day, even as the air turned cold and crisp, heading into October. She frequently took advantage of the benefits of layering and long coats to have a little fun on the way home. Skirts had become her go-to outfits, and with thick tights or leggings underneath, it was simply too good to pass up.

This crisp Wednesday afternoon was no different. June was wearing a gray wool mini skirt, with thick black tights underneath. Half-way home, she stopped and pretended to look at her phone for a minute, so she could relax and let a three second gush of pee soak into her panties and tights. The familiar bloom of warm wetness spread out across her crotch, and June had to stifle a moan. It felt sooo good!

“Hey! What’cha doin’?” said a bright voice right next to her suddenly.

June startled at the sight of Angela, a girl in her program, catching up to her. She seemed eager to chat.

“Eh, oh, nothing, just got a text message,” June said, flustered, holding up her phone before putting it back in her pocket. Every fiber of her being was now acutely aware of the wetness in her pants, hidden by her skirt. Having no choice but to trust (and hope!) that her secret was well hidden, she composed herself and continued walking.

“What’s up?”

“I was just wondering if you and Johnny were going to the department Halloween party,” Angela said. “I heard everyone’s going all out for costumes this year.”

“I don’t know,” June said. “Who’s going?”

“Everyone!” Angela said. “I think everyone’s coming, except for Jared, Rosemary and Ethan.”

June nodded at Angela’s mention of some of the people on the periphery of their program, whom nobody had expected to come.

“You got a costume planned?” June asked.

“Oh, yeah, I’m going as Holly Golightly,” Angela said. “You know, from Breakfast at Tiffany’s?”

The theme of the party was Breakfast. She had already heard countless people talk about dressing up as characters from the Breakfast Club, or, indeed, Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Other, slightly more creative ideas she had heard circulating, was dressing up as Mrs. Butterworth syrup or, simply, as bacon.

“What about you?” Angela asked.

“Don’t know yet, but I think it’ll be food related,” said June.

They chatted for a few minutes, until June had to turn left onto her street and Angela was continuing straight.

As soon as they had said goodbye and June was alone on her street, she breathed a sigh of relief. She hadn’t expected to have to make small talk with wet underwear under her skirt! The wet fabric had clung to her as they walked, impossible to ignore, but June was confident Angela had no idea. She had gotten away with it! Feeling this secret wetness while her friend walked beside her, oblivious, had been incredibly arousing, and now June picked up her phone.

Johnny answered almost immediately.

“Hey, are you home?” June asked.

“Yeah, why?” Johnny wondered.

“Alone, right?” June added.

“Yeees…?”

She could tell from Johnny’s voice that he was catching on, and she could practically hear his smirk through the phone.

“Why…?”

“Just making sure,” June said, as she casually dribbled slowly into her underwear and had to suppress a moan.

Their new driveway was private, with no neighbors with a view to their side yard, so June daringly let her third deliberate dribble continue long enough to leave wet streaks down her tights far below the hem of her skirt.

Johnny had apparently been waiting, because he opened the door and leaned against the doorframe, watching her walk up. He cocked an eyebrow at her, and his eyes glittered.

“I, uh, may have… uh… wet myself a little…” June said, as Johnny pulled her in for a kiss.

“I can see that!” Johnny said. “Although a little may be an understatement…”

***

After a most satisfying shower with Johnny and a change of clothes, they were cuddled up on the couch together.

“I’ve had an idea for costumes for the Halloween party,” June said. “If you want to go?”

“That depends,” Johnny said. “How ridiculous am I going to look?”

The idea had come to her after she and Angela had parted ways. The sensation of wet underwear against her skin while talking with a friend as if nothing was amiss, had triggered something in June. She wanted to feel that again. She even wanted to take it one step further; she wanted to be able to let pee flow into her pants while talking to a friend as if nothing was amiss. The ultimate thrill! But how to go undetected?

She had started thinking about Halloween costumes and the weird shapes they sometimes had. Some of them even had lots of padding to fill out these shapes. And then! The idea had suddenly occurred to her. A diaper! She could get an adult diaper to wear underneath her costume, and nobody would know because of all the padding. It was a little out there, but the more she thought about it, the more she wanted to do it.

“Listen, this is a bit out there, but hear me out,” she said to Johnny.

“I want to be a bowl of Froot Loops,” she continued, and quickly explained her vision.

Johnny just stared at her, brows furrowed. He didn’t get it.

“I think I can make it quite easily and it won’t cost a lot of money either. But here’s the thing. I won’t be able to go to the bathroom in it, and I imagine it will be a nightmare to take off, so I have two options. I can either hold it all night and get really desperate in the end. You might have to take me home early. Or… I can wear a diaper underneath…”

Realization dawned on Johnny, and he chuckled softly, planting a kiss on top of her head.

“I see,” he said. “I get it now. I’ve seen the mountains of laundry that seem to keep accumulating. I saw your tights when you came home today. You really want to try option two, don’t you?”

“Yeah…” she said and blushed, hiding her face against his chest. “Is that weird?”

“Nah,” he said. “Plus, if things go the way I expect they will, there’ll be a nice little bonus for me at the end of the night, won’t it…? You’ll be all riled up!” He grinned at her.

“So, about your costume,” June said. “I figured you could either go as Toucan Sam, to complement my cereal bowl, or you could go as Jason, from Friday the 13th.”

Johnny just stared at her again.

“Jason?” he said. “You lost me. Why Jason? Isn’t that the dude with the hockey mask?”

“Yup,” June said. “You’d be a cereal killer…”

Johnny groaned.

***

The party was in three days. Johnny had decided to go as Jason after all, so he was all set. June was almost finished with her costume, and she was rather pleased with herself.

She had found a giant plastic tub to use for the bowl, and she had cut out holes in the bottom for her legs to go through. To hide her butt from view and to create a platform for her “froot loops” to rest on, she had sewn a white sheet into a circle skirt of sorts, with an elastic waist. She had glued the “hem” of this skirt to the inside edges of the plastic tub, and then glued cut-up pool noodles in different colors all over this skirt. They did, in fact, look like giant froot loops. For effect, she had cut out some stiff cardboard in the shape of a spoon handle, glued that to a stick for rigidity, and then covered the whole thing in aluminum foil before gluing it to the inside of the bowl. It looked great. She was pleased with it. Now she just had to get the final part of the costume. The secret part.

She had been sitting outside the pharmacy for fifteen minutes already, working up the courage to go in. She was in a part of town where nobody knew her, and she had her fake backstory ready. Taking a deep breath, she steeled herself and walked into the pharmacy.

Five minutes later, she was back out in her car, and she let out a sigh of relief. Nobody in the pharmacy had cared, or asked questions. And there, in the passenger seat, sat the final part of her costume. A package of adult incontinence briefs. Like, actual, high absorbency pull-on briefs, not pads. There were twenty-five in the package. Twenty-five!

As soon as she got home, she pulled open the packaging and pulled one out. It looked … strange. She had snuck a couple of baby diapers as a child, but she had never seen one in her size.

“You should try it out beforehand,” Johnny said. “You know, find out how much it can hold. You don’t want to find yourself suddenly overflowing with lots of people around.”

June did NOT, in fact, want to find herself overflowing with lots of people around — Johnny made an excellent point.

She walked into the bathroom, stripped bare on her lower half and pulled one on. It felt really strange. The bulk between her legs felt especially weird, but not altogether uncomfortable. She would potentially be using one of these this weekend, with other people around. June’s pulse quickened, and she could feel her arousal building. She didn’t want to walk around in just the diaper, that felt weird, so she pulled on a loose skirt over the top. The diaper rustled softly when she moved. That was unexpected. Would other people be able to hear that? Nah, her pool noodle froot loops were already crinkly and squeaky — an additional soft rustle would probably not be heard over talking and music and the general noises of her costume.

“How does it feel?” Johnny asked.

“Weird,” June responded.

They went about their afternoon, and halfway into dinner preparations, June felt a slight twinge from her bladder. Figuring there was no time like the present, she let go completely into her diaper. Pee gushed out of her, and at first it felt like a normal wetting — the warm wetness bloomed across her crotch like it normally bloomed out through her underwear. But that was where the similarities ended. As she kept going, the wetness felt both more contained, but also wetter, somehow. Like the diaper acted like a dam, collecting all of her pee. Nothing ran down her legs. Instead, the accumulating pee felt blazing hot against her skin, like she was sitting in a giant hot tub. At one point, June was afraid pee was about to start gushing out the top and sides, and she froze in the middle of chopping an onion.

“What?” Johnny asked.

“I’m peeing…” June whispered, still frozen on the spot.

Her flow slowed and then stopped completely. Empty and relieved, June felt the hot wetness slowly wick away, until the briefs felt completely dry against her skin. Weird.

She felt the outside of her briefs. Perfectly dry. They felt warm to the touch and definitely bulkier than when she had pulled them on, but they were completely dry.

“Weird!” she whispered again, almost to herself, and went back to chopping her onion.

“I’m afraid to sit down,” June said to Johnny when dinner was ready.

“What if it leaks?”

“Just try it,” Johnny said. “Worst case, we clean up after eating. No big deal.”

June sat down gingerly on her chair. The bulk of the briefs felt very strange between her legs, but there was no leaking. So weird!

While cleaning up after dinner, June relaxed and peed into her diaper again. This time, too, she got the strange “hot tub” feeling as the pee spread out inside, before the wetness just … slowly disappeared.

“You should keep it on all night,” Johnny said. “Just keep using it. We’ll get the picnic blanket out and watch a movie or something. You need to figure out how much it can hold.”

So they did. They put on Friday the 13th Part III on DVD, since Johnny was going to be Jason for the party. June gulped down soda and peed a couple more times into her diaper, which still seemed to be holding up. As the movie started to get more intense, however, she forgot about her plan to release small, frequent spurts and just held it, her whole body tense with the tension on the screen. When the end credits rolled and she finally released a deep breath, she realized how much she needed to pee.

“I really have to pee,” she confessed to Johnny. “I’m afraid if I just let it go now, this thing’ll overflow and I’ll make a huge mess! It’s so full already!”

“Just try it,” Johnny said. “If it leaks, it leaks. It’s not like we haven’t cleaned up pee before. Just go as slow as you can.”

June nodded. She started to get up, but Johnny held her back.

“Just stay, babes. I want to watch you.” He kissed her head, which was resting on his chest.

June nodded and settled back into the cuddle. Her arousal was sparking again. She relaxed and tried to let her pee out as slowly as possible, but that was difficult, given how full her bladder had gotten. Her bladder spasmed and released a couple of strong gushes before she was able to control her flow and reduce it to a mere trickle. She was breathing heavily with the effort, and the measured relief was sending her arousal levels sky high.

“Fuck, that feels good!” June said. Johnny kissed the top of her head again.

June kept going for what felt like a long time, before her steady trickle stopped.

“I’m afraid to stand up,” June said, but got up anyway. No leaks! Amazingly, there were no leaks!

“Wow,” Johnny said. “That’s impressive! How does it feel?”

“Still weird,” June said. “I don’t think this will be something I do very often, because I kinda miss feeling the wet fabric, and it doesn’t really feel ‘real’ without that wetness. Also, the bulk between my legs feels … wrong, somehow, but… for a one-time experience, I think I might like it.”

***

The day of the Halloween party had arrived, and June was feeling nervous. Was she really going to go through with this? What if somebody saw? What if somebody found out? What if it leaked and someone saw? What if she was discovered wearing a diaper!?

She was spiraling, and she knew it. “Get it together, June!” she thought to herself. “Nobody will see. Nobody will find out. And it’s not like you can back out now, you can’t go to the bathroom in this costume!”

She took a deep breath and went to the bathroom one last time, before she pulled on her diaper — she still wasn’t used to the weird bulk between her legs — and then the rest of her costume. Johnny had to help tie the straps that went underneath her top and held her bowl up, and then help her into her shoes, because she could not bend properly when she was dressed as cereal, and her shoes would not fit through her leg holes.

When they got to the party, June’s costume was a big hit with everybody and she was fielding question after question about how she had made it and everyone wanted to comment on how creative it was. They also laughed at Johnny’s “cereal killer” costume in relation to hers. Despite herself, June relaxed and had a great time. She had decided that frequent, low-volume spurts of pee would probably be the best strategy for the night, instead of holding and letting go a large gush that would increase the likelihood of overflowing and leaking. She figured that people who actually were incontinent, would likely have a pattern of release like that. Not that she any idea what that was like, not really, but it would make sense, right?

So, at the first twinge of her bladder, June decided to go for it. While talking to a friend from one of the classes in her program, she relaxed and peed. It was surprisingly difficult with so many people around, but she eventually managed.

The familiar bloom of warm wetness across her entire crotch caused her to space out completely from the conversation. June could feel her cheeks burning, and she likely had those red splotches on her neck and chest that she always got when she was stressed about something. Her heart felt like it was about to beat right out of her chest. When she was again able to focus and be fully present in the room, she had to ask her friend to repeat herself. She had wet herself in the middle of this packed room, deep in conversation with her friend, and NOBODY knew about it! She had PEED herself! In public! With lots of people around! And nobody knew!

Fuck! What a rush! June could not stop grinning, and she was so turned on that her entire sex throbbed painfully.

She locked eyes with Johnny across the room. He was talking to a mutual friend of theirs.

She just raised her eyebrows at him and grinned widely.

He cocked an eyebrow and winked at her, then pursed his lips in an air kiss.

June’s arousal stayed at a simmering low burn all evening, fed by her constant dribbles and small spurts into her diaper at the faintest twinge from her bladder. She got better at relaxing as the night progressed, and she likely had the widest grin of all in the ‘most creative costume’ group photo she posed for. It was for the faculty newsletter, and June wondered what her peers would think if they knew she was gushing pee into her pants right as the photo was taken. She prayed they would never know, but she doubted she would ever be able to think of anything else every time she saw the photo.

By the time the party was dying down, June was ready to go home. It felt like her diaper was approaching capacity, and she was ready to get out of her bowl and be able to sit down properly again. She and Johnny said their goodbyes and started walking home.

“So, how was it?” Johnny asked as they made their way home at a leisurely pace. June couldn’t walk very fast due to her costume. “You ok?”

“I hate the bulk and the heaviness,” June said. “I won’t be making these a regular thing. But FUCK! The THRILL of just letting go whenever I want and the sensation of secretly gushing into my pants WHILE I’m talking to someone, and they have no idea?!? It’s the best feeling ever! I’ve seriously been turned on since we arrived.”

“Have you now…?” said Johnny, cocking his eyebrow at her again. “Well… I have a remedy for that when we get home…”

June moaned and leaned in to kiss him. Without even thinking about it or consciously deciding to, she could feel herself peeing. She gasped.

“What?” Johnny asked.

“I peed!” June exclaimed. “It wasn’t on purpose, it just happened! Oh, no! What if I can’t stop now?”

“Relax!” Johnny said. “You won’t forget how to hold it after just one night. It’s just because you’re still wearing that thing and you’ve been doing it all night. You’ll be fine.”

“I hope so,” June murmured. “Turns me on, though…” she added. “Fuck, I’m so turned on!”

She had been holding back on the drinking at the party, both to stay in control of her … situation, and to limit her fluid intake somewhat, but the little bit of alcohol in her system was making her feel reckless again now that it was just her and Johnny.

“I think we need to get the picnic blanket out, babe,” she giggled.

“Fuck, yes!” Johnny responded, his eyes glittering.

June retreated to the bathroom alone to remove her very heavy diaper when they got home. No leaks! June was very impressed, but it did not feel like a very sexy thing to her, removing the soggy briefs, so she preferred to do it solo. In addition, since her first release into them had been hours ago, there was also a tiny bit of a smell, which she did not care for. So she got naked from the waist down and cleaned up quickly with a washcloth before she joined Johnny in the bedroom. The picnic blanket had been carefully spread out over the bed, and he was draped across it in a mock seductive position, dressed only in his boxer briefs, with a grin on his face.

June was about ready to jump his bones, but he pulled her down on to the bed with him, snuggling in and kissing her deeply. She put her hand down to grab his semi-erect cock through his boxer briefs and gasped when she felt the material grow hot and wet under her touch.

Johnny was peeing! Johnny was peeing on her hand!

She broke the kiss and just stared at him, eyes glittering, but she did not remove her hand, and the wet trickle under her fingers continued for several seconds before it stopped. Johnny was lying partially on his left side, facing her, and the entire front and left side of his boxer briefs were soaked, as was the picnic blanket underneath them.

“What?” he said with a mischievous grin. “I didn’t want to let you have all the fun this evening. I felt left out!”

“You don’t mind, do you?” he added, with mock concern.

June rolled onto her back and pulled Johnny with her, on top of her.

“I do NOT mind,” she said and kissed him.

“THAT was HOT! Fuck! You’re making me so horny! I want you in me. Now.”

Johnny turned her around, so that she was on her hands and knees with her back to him. He pulled his wet boxer briefs down and gently guided himself into position. As he slid into her, she could feel his wet boxers against the backs of her thighs, and June moaned in pleasure and sunk down onto her elbows. Fuck, that felt good! He always got her G-spot in this position. While thrusting slowly, turning June inside out with pleasure, Johnny reached around and started gently massaging her clit. June let out a whimper, close to climax already.

“God, you feel so good on my cock!” Johnny said and continued his slow thrusting and gentle massage. “You looked gorgeous tonight, you know. Cereal bowl and all. Fuck! You were so sexy. You were practically glowing! All I could think about tonight was you getting all riled up from your secret naughty business, and I was half-hard all night.”

June could only moan in response. The stimulation of her G-spot and clit at the same time had rendered her speechless. She felt the urge to pee and didn’t fight it. It hissed underneath Johnny’s fingers, and splashed everywhere, but he just increased his speed and pressure. June came hard, her muscles clenching in a steady rhythm.

“Fuck! Yes! Oh, God, yes! Jesus!” she heard Johnny say, and his thrusting became faster and more forceful, until he, too, came, and she could feel him spill inside her.

They collapsed on the bed beside each other, breathing heavily.

“I still have to pee,” Johnny whispered. “Do you… Can I…?”

“Do it!” June said. “Just stay. Don’t get up. Hold me.” She squeezed his arm underneath her and snuggled even closer to him as the little spoon. Her entire back was pressed up against Johnny’s front, and suddenly she felt a warm gushing against her butt. Wetness pooled underneath their bodies.

They stayed snuggled up until the wetness started to cool before they got up and carefully cleaned up everything and took a shower, giggling the entire time.

Clean-up really was a bitch, but it was sooo worth it!
