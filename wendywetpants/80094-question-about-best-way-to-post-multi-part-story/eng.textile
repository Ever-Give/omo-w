Hi, fellow dribblers and gushers!

I've been in a position lately where my interest in wetting has been very much ON, but my opportunities to browse and/or indulge have been very limited. Therefore, I have resorted to an old standby — making up shit in my head and writing it down. A Word document, after all, is very easy to minimize and hide and does not look particularly sus, and now I have A LOT of pages with something that is essentially explicit wetting smut.

I want to share it here, but I thought I would ask what the best way of posting it is.

Is it better to just keep adding the subsequent parts as new comments whenever I get them finished, or should I add them all separately? I'm thinking it's best to keep it all in one place, right?

And how do I handle tags if I do that? Should I add tags that apply to the whole story, even if the things that are referenced by the tags do not appear until a later instalment? Can I edit the tags as I add instalments?

Suggestions welcome.
