I'm a huge fan of the metal group BabyMetal. I was wondering if anyone else here is a fan or would be willing to write an omo story involving their front woman Su Metal. The ideal setting would be during a live concert. The accident could happen either onstage or just as she reaches the backstage area at the end of the concert. Messing is a plus, but only a solid mess. Preferably in her stage outfit as well. I'd also like a good bit of buildup/desperation before the actual accident. If anyone is interested, let me know. Thanks in advance.
