It has been quiet for a long while, I hope that Katy hasn't fallen out of love with this particular story. It would be tragic for it to go unfinished, especially knowing that another couple of chapters are interested pipeline - it's definitely well inside my Top 5.

I do plan to come back to it. I know it’s a favourite of quite a few people. Unfortunately this story has a “sexy and fun” feel and right now I’m feeling “anxious and disconsolate” so I’m working on stories that better fit that vibe. If I wrote a chapter of ITYSJPYP it’d almost certainly take a turn that people wouldn’t like!

I'd like any form of continuation to this story.

Whelp, OK! I have two things I want to write first, so we’re still looking at a month or so. But I want no complaints if Sad Katy decides to take this story right into heartbreak town. :p
