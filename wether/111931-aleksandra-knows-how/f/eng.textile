Here is the story of Aleksandra Wiejak, a fictional candidate in Poland’s elections. During a rally with voters, she desperately needs to pee. After the event, she sprints to a nearby pizzeria, finding a restroom just in the nick of time. Any resemblance to real persons is purely coincidental, and the political slogans used are solely to capture the atmosphere of the campaign rally. Will Aleksandra win the election? We’ll find out soon!

Aleksandra Wiejak’s surname, pronounced “Vye-yak,” cleverly translates to “knows how” in Polish, a fitting nod to her campaign’s theme of competence and solutions. Her supporters embraced this, turning it into the rallying cry: “Aleksandra Wiejak – wie, jak!” or “Aleksandra knows how!”

Aleksandra Knows How

The sun dipped low, painting city square in a warm, golden glow as a black van screeched to a halt at the edge of the crowd. Aleksandra Wiejak, slightly late after a four-hour drive from her hometown, leapt out, adjusting her navy, impeccably tailored suit that perfectly accentuated her slender, proportionate frame. Her short, chestnut hair gleamed in the evening light. With brisk steps, she headed toward the stage, the suit’s sleek, elegant cut – paired with a crisp white shirt and a vibrant emerald scarf – exuding modernity, the scarf adding a touch of individuality. The crowd, gathered before an old factory, surged with enthusiasm, hoisting banners proclaiming, “Aleksandra Wiejak – knows how!” There was no time to catch her breath – organizers, spotting her arrival, urgently signaled for her to take the podium.

Aleksandra felt a sharp twinge in her lower abdomen – after hours on the road without a single stop, her bladder was demanding attention. I’ll hold it, she thought, clenching her jaw and forcing a smile. A trip to the restroom was out of the question; the crowd chanted her name, and the microphone awaited. She climbed onto the stage, striving for grace despite the silent battle raging within. Her chestnut hair shimmered under the spotlights, and her suit, pristine despite the journey, lent her an air of poise.

“Dear friends, I’m sorry for being late, but I’m here because I believe we can do more together!” she began, her voice warm yet resolute, carrying across the square. The crowd erupted in applause, and she pressed on, despite the growing pressure in her bladder. “We want a Poland where no one is left behind,” she continued. “A Poland where every family has access to quality preschools, where schools teach critical thinking, and healthcare is a right, not a privilege!” God, why didn’t I use the restroom before leaving? she thought, each movement requiring superhuman control.

The stage buzzed with life. The square, steeped in the spirit of its industrial past, now brimmed with hope for change. A young woman clutched a sign reading “Equality is the Future,” while an older man in a woolen sweater nodded along. Aleksandra, in her neat suit and emerald scarf, seemed both one of them and a leader. “We stand here together because we believe Poland can be a home for all,” she said, her voice gaining strength. “Not just for the select few, not for those who shout the loudest, but for everyone who seeks justice and respect. We’re here because more unites us than divides us!” The crowd roared, some eyes glistening with tears. A breeze carried the scent of blooming trees, and the square pulsed with the energy of people who believed change was possible. Aleksandra, despite the throbbing ache in her abdomen, stood tall, soaking in the moment.

As her speech concluded, the crowd grew even more animated – it was time for questions. Hands shot up, and Aleksandra, feeling her bladder scream for relief, took a deep breath. Just a few minutes, I can do this, she told herself. A young father in glasses spoke first. “What about preschools? My kids are stuck on waiting lists!” he shouted. “We’ll invest in public preschools – every child deserves a chance,” she replied, clenching her thighs. A middle-aged teacher followed: “And schools? Overcrowded classes, low pay!”

“Smaller classes, better salaries for teachers – it’s a must,” she answered, a wave of pressure surging in her lower belly. Questions poured in like an avalanche: healthcare (“We’ll cut specialist wait times!”), roads (“Infrastructure investments, but sustainable ones”), neighborhoods and housing (“Affordable rentals for the young”). Each response was sharp, but with every word, Aleksandra felt her bladder was a ticking bomb. Sweat beaded on her forehead, her legs trembling from the effort. Don’t think about water, don’t think about streams, she repeated, struggling to keep smiling.

Then a woman in her thirties, wearing a denim jacket, raised her hand. “Ms. Aleksandra, what about public restrooms? They’re nowhere to be found!” The crowd chuckled, but for Aleksandra, the question hit like a thunderbolt. Her body twitched involuntarily, warmth spreading in her lower abdomen. No, I won’t lose it on stage! she screamed internally, nearly gasping. Her voice cracked: “That’s… a critical issue,” she began, squeezing her thighs so tightly she nearly lost balance. “Clean, accessible restrooms are essential for dignified city life.” The crowd nodded, but her mind roared: End this now, or I’ll wet my pants! Why didn’t I wear a skirt?! Mercifully, the questions stopped. “Thank you for your energy and faith! I’m counting on your votes!” she called, forcing a final smile before staggering off the podium, every second a battle for survival.

The moment her feet hit the ground, she grabbed her assistant, Kasia, her eyes wild with panic. “Kasia, restroom, now! I’m about to wet myself!” she whispered, her voice trembling with urgency. Kasia, sensing the crisis, scanned the area. “Pizzeria on the corner, run!” she shouted, pointing across the square. Aleksandra bolted through the crowd like an Olympic sprinter, her chestnut hair whipping in the wind, her suit now a suffocating cage. People parted, some confused, others amused, as she barreled past. She stumbled over a curb, nearly falling, but adrenaline propelled her forward. “Sorry, sorry!” she gasped, shoving through the throng. Her heart pounded, her bladder on the verge of bursting with each step. Onlookers turned, whispers and laughter rippling, but she didn’t care – the pizzeria’s neon sign was her beacon in the storm.

She burst inside like a tornado, weaving past tables of stunned diners. The scent of pizza and chatter faded as all eyes locked on the candidate, her face a mask of desperation. The women’s restroom was occupied – a line of three women stood outside. “I can’t wait!” she hissed to Kasia, a bead of sweat rolling down her temple, legs shaking. Kasia, unfazed, checked the men’s room. “Empty, go!” she yelled. Aleksandra charged into the stall, slamming the door. Her sweat-slick fingers fumbled with her belt and zipper, yanking down her pants and underwear in a frantic blur. Before she could sit, a torrential stream of urine gushed, soaking her underwear and the hem of her pants. She let out a loud sigh, nearly sobbing with relief, her head resting against the stall wall. Emerging with a look of blissful release, she caught the raised eyebrows of a few patrons. Someone snapped a photo, another whispered with a grin.

Her dash to the men’s restroom didn’t go unnoticed. Social media soon exploded with memes and comments, dubbing Aleksandra “the candidate like every woman – sometimes she needs to pee.” Rather than shy away, she leaned into it with humor, winning hearts. At her next rally, days later, she quipped, “What’s the real test for a candidate? Holding it for four hours on the road and still talking equality!” The crowd roared, and signs reading “Restrooms for All!” popped up at her events. She wove the issue into her platform, pledging more public restrooms in cities, accessible to families, seniors, and people with disabilities. The slogan “Aleksandra Wiejak – knows how to meet our needs!” went viral, blending her serious agenda with a relatable, human touch.

The impact showed in the polls – her numbers climbed, especially among younger voters and women, who admired her authenticity and knack for turning a mishap into a strength. The media, initially poking fun at the “restroom incident,” began noting how she’d sparked a serious conversation about urban infrastructure. But would this charm and catchy slogans secure victory? Could her charisma, platform, and humor outshine political heavyweights? The answer would come on election day, when the ballots would reveal if Aleksandra Wiejak truly “knows how” to win Poland’s heart.

Aleksandra Knows How - Part 2: The Debate

A week before the elections, Warsaw’s television studio buzzed with frenetic energy. It was the final presidential debate, broadcast live on public television—dynamic, emotionally charged, with a dozen candidates ready to fight for every vote. Aleksandra Wiejak, dressed in a long, narrow black skirt and a burgundy blazer, looked elegant yet approachable, thanks to her signature emerald scarf. Her short, chestnut hair was neatly styled, and subtle makeup highlighted her vibrant aura. Her surname, “Wiejak”—meaning “knows how” in Polish—continued to echo through her campaign, with the slogan “Aleksandra Wiejak – knows how!” rallying crowds.

Final preparations took place in the cramped studio dressing room. A makeup artist and stylist fussed around Aleksandra, touching up powder and lipstick while she reviewed her notes. In the narrow, crowded corridor leading to the studio, filled with assistants and camera operators, Aleksandra glanced at the restroom door. Maybe one more time, just in case? she thought but quickly dismissed the idea. She’d used the restroom an hour ago, felt no urge, and needed to discuss last-minute details with her assistant, Kasia, about responses to economic questions. Two hours, I’ll manage, she reassured herself, adjusting her scarf and heading to the studio.

In the studio, candidates took their places behind podiums resembling lecterns, arranged in a semicircle, each equipped with a small glass of water and a notepad. Aleksandra stood tall, hands resting on her podium, ready for the challenge. Soon, the spotlights flared, bathing her in warm light. She bowed, smiled, and said a simple “Good evening,” unlike some rivals who opted for florid greetings like “Ladies and gentlemen, I greet you in the name of the future!” The moderators, two seasoned journalists, kicked off the debate, dividing questions into thematic blocks: economy, social policy, security, foreign policy, and vision for the presidency. Each candidate had 60 seconds to respond, with the studio audience and viewers at home awaiting substance.

The first block focused on the economy. One question was: “How do you plan to combat inflation, which hits the poorest hardest?” Aleksandra answered confidently, leaning slightly over her podium: “We must increase access to affordable housing and introduce progressive taxes to ease the burden on the most vulnerable. Inflation isn’t just numbers—it’s the daily struggles of families.” Her voice was calm but firm, earning applause from the audience. Another candidate, a right-wing representative, promised tax cuts for entrepreneurs, stirring murmurs among viewers. Subsequent blocks—healthcare (“We’ll shorten specialist wait times!” Aleksandra declared), education, security—unfolded at a brisk pace, with sharp exchanges and attempts to dominate the conversation.

During the debate, Aleksandra sipped water from the glass on her podium—partly to keep her throat moist, partly to calm her nerves. With each sip, she felt more assured, but a subtle tension began to build in her lower abdomen. Just stress, she thought, brushing it off. However, the debate, meant to last two hours, dragged on due to heated discussions and extra questions from the moderators. As the scheduled end time passed, Aleksandra realized her bladder was making itself known. Why didn’t I use the restroom? she scolded herself, clenching her thighs and striving to maintain a composed stance behind her podium.

The round of mutual questions only worsened her plight. One rival, an older man with conservative views, decided to target Aleksandra, alluding to her “restroom incident” from the rally. “Ms. Wiejak, you speak of equality, but how do you see women’s role in the military, where conditions, including access to restrooms, are tougher? Should women receive special treatment?” he asked with a sly smirk, prompting a ripple in the studio. Aleksandra felt her face flush, her bladder tightening as if in defiance. He did that on purpose, she thought, resisting the urge to shift her position behind the podium. 

“My dear colleague, in the military, as in life, the key is equal opportunity, not privileges. Women are ready to serve if we provide basic infrastructure—like restrooms, which, as we’ve seen, are an issue not just in the army but in campaigns,” she replied with a smile, deftly parrying the jab. The audience chuckled, and she scored points for her retort, but inside, she felt adrenaline amplifying her need.

An hour past the scheduled end, the debate showed no signs of stopping. Questions grew sharper, emotions flared, and some candidates’ faces betrayed exhaustion from the grueling campaign nearing its end. Aleksandra, though still answering with vigor, was increasingly distracted. How are they all so calm? she wondered, glancing at her smiling rivals, who seemed unfazed behind their podiums. Her thoughts increasingly circled her brimming bladder, and her long, narrow skirt, while elegant, hindered discreet movements, forcing her to stand nearly motionless. She tightened her muscles, trying to focus on the questions, but the fear of another “restroom meme” loomed larger than political attacks. Hold on, just a bit longer, she repeated, though the debate dragged on, and the spotlights continued to illuminate her tense figure at the podium.

An hour and a half past the scheduled time, the debate finally concluded. The spotlights dimmed, and candidates began leaving the studio, exchanging curt pleasantries or casting final competitive glances. Aleksandra Wiejak, positioned at the podium farthest from the exit, felt her bladder throb with every breath. Her long, narrow black skirt, though stylish, restricted movement, and her burgundy blazer and emerald scarf, which lent her charisma, now felt like added weight. She didn’t want to push through the crowd—with a full bladder, she preferred not to risk sudden movements. She left the studio last, walking slowly with clenched thighs, a motion her tight skirt fortunately concealed. The urge to grab herself between her legs, even briefly, was overwhelming, but the awareness of cameras and onlookers stopped her from such a desperate gesture. Just stay calm, you can do this, she told herself, though each step was agony.

The narrow corridor to the dressing room resembled a maze of obstacles. Candidates, their assistants, technicians, and TV staff milled about, discussing the debate or hurrying to tasks. Aleksandra, striving to maintain dignity, walked cautiously, passing heated conversations and curious glances. “Ms. Wiejak, great restroom comeback!” an assistant called out, but she only nodded, unwilling to waste energy on a reply. With each step, she was closer to the restroom, but the fear of not making it grew. If I lose it now, memes will ruin my campaign, she thought, clenching her muscles with all her strength. Her mind replayed the viral rally incident that had won her sympathy, but another could be seen as a fiasco.

She reached the women’s restroom, but her heart sank—a line awaited. Three other candidates, who had evidently arrived earlier, stood in queue. The rival just ahead of Aleksandra, a middle-aged woman with impeccable posture, showed no signs of distress, calmly adjusting her hair in a compact mirror. Aleksandra, sweat beading on her neck, considered asking to cut in. One word, and I could be inside, she thought, but then imagined headlines: “Wiejak begs for the restroom!” No, I can’t. I have too much to do for the people, she resolved, gritting her teeth and trying to appear composed, though her legs trembled and her hands involuntarily clenched into fists.

Finally, the stall door opened. Aleksandra rushed in, nearly tripping over the threshold. In her panic, she began unfastening her narrow skirt, as if forgetting it could be hiked up—though its long, tight fit would have made that tricky, clinging to her hips. Her sweat-slick fingers fumbled with the zipper, and as she yanked down her skirt, she tore at her pantyhose and underwear. She didn’t make it to sitting—a torrent of urine burst forth, splashing off the toilet seat, a few drops landing on her underwear and the floor. But it didn’t matter. Relief washed over her like a tidal wave, nearly taking her breath away. She leaned against the stall wall, letting out a loud sigh, her body relaxing for the first time in hours. Never again will I skip the restroom before a debate, she vowed, closing her eyes.

She wiped herself, adjusted her clothes, and stepped out, striving to regain her composure. At the sink stood the same rival who had seemed so unruffled earlier. Aleksandra, still slightly flushed, couldn’t resist.

– How do you do it? How do you hold it? – she asked, washing her hands.

The woman gave a small smile, as if sharing a secret.

– Barely – she admitted – I thought I wouldn’t make it.

Aleksandra raised her eyebrows, surprised.

– But you didn’t show a thing!

The rival shrugged, drying her hands.

– Because politics, my dear, is the art of pretending everything’s fine. You have to put on a good face, even when the game isn’t great. Good luck! – she said, leaving the restroom.

Aleksandra lingered at the sink, studying her reflection. The flush was fading, and her emerald scarf still lent her confidence. Maybe I need to learn that trick, she thought, smiling to herself. The restroom incident didn’t reach the media—this time, the cameras missed her. But the conversation with her rival gave her a new perspective. The campaign was a game of appearances, but Aleksandra knew her authenticity—even with “restroom” mishaps—was what drew voters. Would it be enough to win? The week leading to the elections would reveal whether “Aleksandra Wiejak – knows how” could capture Poland’s heart.

Aleksandra Knows How – Part 3: Election Night

The election night of the first round of the 2025 presidential elections thrummed with emotion. In Aleksandra Wiejak’s campaign headquarters, located in a modern office building in central Warsaw, a crowd of supporters, volunteers, and team members stared at television screens, awaiting the exit poll results. Aleksandra, dressed in a navy dress with a subtle slit and her signature emerald scarf, stood at the center, surrounded by her closest aides. Her short, chestnut hair gleamed under the spotlights, but her face betrayed tension laced with quiet hope. Polls had given her up to 25% support, offering a shot at the second round, but her conservative rival was close behind. 

Toward the end of the campaign, the internet was flooded with memes mocking her lack of experience and “restroom adventures”—from jabs about the “candidate who runs to the bathroom” to snide remarks that “the presidency isn’t a sprint to the toilet.” Aleksandra, though initially stung by shame, had learned to take it with humor, seeing how the memes paradoxically bolstered her authentic image among younger voters. Let them laugh, as long as they vote, she thought, her heart racing and her stomach knotting with nerves. On top of that, a full bladder, fueled by coffees and water, nagged at her with every breath, as if the evening’s emotions were conspiring to break her.

The 9:00 p.m. deadline loomed. The TV studio was connecting with various campaign headquarters, showing enthusiastic crowds and candidates in suspense. Aleksandra, standing among her team, felt the urge to pee growing, throbbing in her lower abdomen. Not now, not at a moment like this, she pleaded inwardly, clenching her thighs beneath her dress. She couldn’t go to the restroom—she didn’t know when the broadcast would switch to her headquarters, and leaving at a crucial moment risked being caught on camera. Every sip of coffee, every glass of water she’d drunk to calm her nerves, now felt like betrayal. 

The need wasn’t critical yet but distracting enough to unsettle her. She tried to stand straight, maintaining a serious expression, exchanging quiet remarks with her assistant, Kasia, who teased about the memes to lighten the mood. But Aleksandra barely listened—her thoughts toggled between dread over the results and a battle with her own body. Hold on, it’s just an hour, she repeated, though her leg muscles trembled, and she subtly shifted her stance to ease the pressure.

When the clock struck 9:00 p.m., the exit poll results flashed on the screen. A deathly silence fell over the headquarters, broken only by quickened breaths. First place went to her rival—the woman she’d spoken with in the restroom after the debate, who had shared the secret of “the art of pretending” in politics. Second place belonged to the conservative opponent who had attacked Aleksandra for her “lack of seriousness.” Aleksandra, with 20% of the vote, came in third. Her heart skipped a beat, her face freezing in a mix of shock and sorrow. Third? she thought, feeling her hopes for the second round dissolve like mist. 

Two women in the runoff would have been a historic triumph, but the results were merciless—her rival and the conservative held a clear lead. Deep down, she felt shattered, as if her dream had been ripped away. Her bladder, as if sensing her vulnerability, tightened even more, and she had to muster all her strength not to wince in pain. I can’t break down, not in front of them, she thought, glancing at the crowd of supporters who still believed in her.

When the broadcast switched to Aleksandra’s headquarters, cameras captured her at the center, surrounded by emotional faces. She stood with dignity, though the need to pee was now almost unbearable. Every movement, every breath felt like teetering on the edge of disaster. “Thank you for your support, for every meeting, every conversation,” she began, her voice trembling slightly, not just from emotion but from the effort to maintain control over her body. “This isn’t the end of our journey. Your energy, your belief in a just Poland, cannot go to waste.” She paused, her bladder screaming for relief as the crowd’s hopeful eyes fixed on her. 

She recalled the 1990 election night when Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Poland’s first post-communist prime minister, announced a new political movement after his defeat. An impulse guided her words. “That’s why we’re launching a new social movement to fight for our shared ideals!” she declared with a smile, though inside she fought not to cross her legs. The headquarters erupted in applause and cheers, though a few exchanged surprised glances. The cameras cut away, and the crowd chanted, “Wiejak knows how!”

As soon as the broadcast ended, Aleksandra, maintaining her composure, leaned toward Kasia and whispered, “I’m going to the bathroom… finally.” There was no trace of her former panic, only a quiet resolve, as if the lesson from her restroom rival—“politics is the art of pretending”—had taken root. She moved through the crowd of supporters, still serious, though each step required clenching her muscles. She calmly entered the bathroom, closed the stall door, and with relief hiked up her navy dress, pulling down her pantyhose and underwear. The stream of urine gushed with such force that she sighed softly, leaning against the stall wall.

Sitting on the toilet, she reflected on what she’d just announced. A new social movement? Can I even pull this off? Have I overestimated my strength? Do I really know how? she questioned, her heart pounding with a mix of excitement and fear. The sting of defeat still throbbed, but the memory of her voters’ eyes, their signs, their faith, gave her strength. I can’t let them down, she thought, a tear rolling down her cheek, mingling with the physical relief. She peed surprisingly long, as if the entire evening’s tension had found release. She stood, wiped herself, washed her hands, adjusted her clothes, and returned to the headquarters with a smile.

***

A week later, as the dust of the first round settled, the candidate who advanced to the second round—the same one Aleksandra had spoken with in the restroom—reached out. In a candid conversation, she began, “I admire your enthusiasm, youthful energy, and the sincerity of your message, Aleksandra. Your campaign inspired so many. I’d like to ask for your endorsement in the second round. 

In return, I’ll incorporate the key elements of your platform: more public restrooms, better preschools, equality for all.” Aleksandra paused, hesitating. “What about my mishaps? I don’t want the toilet memes to weigh you down,” she said with a hint of uncertainty. The rival smiled. “That’s not an issue. I have experience in politics; I can handle it. Your authenticity is an asset, not a flaw.” Aleksandra, after a moment’s thought, felt it was the right move. Her vision for Poland could live on, even if not as president. “Together, we can do more,” she replied, her words echoing her campaign. A new social movement was already taking shape in her mind, and endorsing her rival was the first step on a new path.

Here's much delayed 4th part, and probably the last one - maybe until the nex elections 😉

Aleksandra Knows How – Part 4: Second Round and Finale

The election night of the second round of the 2025 presidential elections was a storm of emotions ready to erupt like a volcano. Aleksandra Wiejak, invited as a commentator to a Warsaw television studio, sat in full readiness among politicians, experts, and journalists. Dressed in a narrow black skirt, white blouse, and her signature emerald scarf, she exuded class, but inside, she battled mounting chaos. Her chestnut hair gleamed under the spotlights, yet her eyes betrayed fatigue and anxiety. 

The exit poll results were set to be announced at 9:00 p.m., and the duel between Zofia—the candidate Aleksandra endorsed, the one from the memorable restroom chat after the debate—and Krzysztof, the conservative rival, was nearly a dead heat, with polls showing a 50:50 split. The studio demanded constant vigilance, meaning she couldn’t leave her seat without risk. The narrow, crowded corridor to the restrooms, teeming with assistants, technicians, and guests, was daunting, and whispers of queues at the women’s bathroom only heightened her unease. Aleksandra, wiser from experience, sipped water sparingly, but hours of tension and emotion made her bladder throb with increasing pain. Damn it, not now! she thought, clenching her thighs under the table, feeling the urge become almost an adversary.

The clock struck 9:00 p.m. The exit poll results flashed on the screen, confirming a near-perfect tie. The studio buzzed, and the host turned to Aleksandra: “Ms. Wiejak, how do you comment on these results? What led to such a tight race?”

Despite the pulsing ache in her lower abdomen, Aleksandra straightened up, took a breath, and responded, with her voice heavy with emotion:

– These results show how deeply divided Poland is, but also how much every vote matters. This campaign was full of passion, but too often it relied on emotions, populist tactics, and attempts to ridicule opponents—as with the memes that targeted me, too. I wish politics were a battle of arguments, of visions for a better future. I believe the candidate I endorsed brings values that can unite Poles: justice, equality, care for everyday needs like infrastructure or education. I hope that will tip the scales, because Poland deserves a president who builds, not divides.

Her passionate words earned applause from some guests, but inside, she felt each breath intensify the pressure in her bladder. Just a bit longer, hold on, she pleaded with herself, recalling Zofia’s lesson about the “art of pretending.”

After hours of sitting in the studio, in a state of constant readiness, the results began to show a slight edge for Zofia. When the host wrapped up the program, Aleksandra felt her bladder on the verge of bursting. The need to pee was not just painful but nearly paralyzing—each step threatened loss of control. She headed toward the restrooms, but in the narrow, crowded corridor, she saw a queue at the women’s bathroom: four women, including journalists and assistants, waited, chatting calmly. I can’t make it, no way, she thought, with panic gripping her throat. Her legs trembled, and her hands instinctively clenched into fists, resisting the urge to grab herself between her legs. In desperation, she glanced at the men’s restroom door. This is madness, but I have no choice, she decided, pushed the door open, and stepped inside, with her heart pounding like a hammer.

Inside, at the urinal, stood Krzysztof—the same one who had mocked her “lack of seriousness” during the campaign. He turned, his eyes widening in shock. “You, here?!” he exclaimed, nearly dropping his jacket. Aleksandra, her face burning with shame, felt a few drops of urine escape involuntarily, dampening her underwear. “Sorry, I really need to pee!” she blurted out, stunned by her own bluntness, but panic had stripped her of restraint. “But this is the men’s restroom,” he noted, still at the urinal, his voice teetering between astonishment and amusement. “You pee into a urinal.” Aleksandra, sensing no way back, took up the challenge, though her legs nearly buckled under the weight of desperation.

She hiked up her narrow skirt, turned her back to the urinal, and tried to aim, but her hands shook. “Face forward,” Krzysztof said with a sly smirk. “In the men’s room, you pee facing the urinal.” Surprised but determined, she turned around, lifting her skirt from the front. With her last ounce of strength, her sweat-slick fingers yanked down her pantyhose and underwear, and a powerful stream of urine gushed into the urinal. Her aim faltered—the stream, like an untamed waterfall, splashed onto the floor, her shoes, and the urinal’s edge. Amid the chaos, Aleksandra felt relief so intense she nearly slumped against the wall, her breath turning into a soft moan.

Still in shock, she grabbed a paper towel and wiped her drenched shoes. Her cheeks were burning with embarrassment. At the sinks, she met Krzysztof, who was washing his hands, looking at her with genuine respect.

– I underestimated you, I’m sorry – he said quietly, with a note of humility in his voice – Those memes mocking you… they were my team’s doing. I regret it now. Your authenticity is something that can’t be faked. You… you really know how.

He paused, and then added:

– Despite our differences, I’d like to propose we work together. Maybe meet over a beer to discuss how we can serve Poland?

Aleksandra, still slightly embarrassed but growing in confidence, flashed a playful smile.

– Beer? You want to kill my bladder? – she quipped, surprising herself with her boldness, then added more seriously – But sure, let’s talk. Maybe over coffee instead – she left the restroom with her head held high, feeling a new chapter begin.

The second-round results confirmed Zofia’s victory—narrow, but decisive. Though Aleksandra didn’t become president, she knew her social movement, inspired by her voters’ faith and her own “adventures,” could transform Poland. The restroom memes still circulated, but now they symbolized her courage and authenticity. Krzysztof’s offer of collaboration, delivered with surprising warmth over the idea of a beer, hinted at bridging divides. Wiejak knows how, she thought, ready for the next fight, believing that even with opponents, common ground could be found—perhaps over a pint or a cup of coffee.
