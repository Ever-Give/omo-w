Olena

Here is the story of Olena, a 20-year-old girl from Ukraine, seeking a better life in Poland. It begins around 2017. The idea for the story came while I was trimming the hedge, but beyond that, everything is fiction, and any resemblance to real people is coincidental. Contains pee desperation, a bit of humiliation, and peeing in a toilet. The story will have few parts...

Olena, part 1 – The Hedge

I was trimming the hedge in front of the house when the clatter of suitcase wheels on the uneven sidewalk caught my attention. I looked up and saw her—a young woman, about twenty years old, maybe a bit older. She was of average height, rather petite but not frail; there was something resilient in her movements, as if she was used to long days on her feet. Dressed in a light t-shirt with a faded sports brand logo and gray leggings—tight but not flashy, more practical than fashionable—she looked like someone who valued comfort over style. A small backpack hung over one shoulder, and she dragged a worn suitcase behind her, one wheel slightly broken, bouncing with an annoying clack every few steps.

She wasn’t a classic beauty. Her face was rather ordinary—a slightly upturned nose, pale cheeks dusted with faint freckles that probably only appeared in summer, and light brown hair tied in a loose, slightly messy ponytail. But there was something about her, a certain charm I’d sometimes noticed in women from Eastern Europe. Maybe it was her eyes, large and gray-green, a mix of curiosity, anxiety, and quiet determination. Or maybe it was the way she moved—with a hint of shyness but also stubbornness, as if she refused to give up, no matter the circumstances.

She kept glancing at her phone, frowning, and looking around, as if searching for a sign, a house number, or a street. I finished leveling one edge of the hedge and was about to get back to work when she reappeared. This time, she was walking back, faster, her face tense. The suitcase bounced behind her like a stubborn shadow, and she adjusted the backpack strap that kept slipping off her shoulder. She looked exhausted—faint shadows under her eyes, her steps, though still energetic, betraying that she’d been on her feet for a while. I figured she’d probably arrived on an early bus, one of those cheap ones that stop at every possible station.

I set down the hedge trimmers and leaned against the fence.

– Hey, can I help you with something? – I asked, more out of curiosity than genuine eagerness.

She stopped, looked at me with slight wariness, but after a moment, she replied. Her voice was quiet, with a distinct accent—soft, melodic, sounding like a mix of Polish and something more eastern, maybe Ukrainian.

– I’m looking for number 120. Do you know where it is?

I shook my head.

– They’ve built a few new houses around here recently, but the numbering stops at 100. There’s definitely no 120. Maybe you have the wrong address? Or the street name’s mixed up?

Her face paled, and her eyes widened for a moment. She frowned, as if trying to recall something, and glanced at her phone again, scrolling with her finger. I could tell it worried her—really worried her. She pressed her lips together, and her hand, the one holding the phone, dropped limply to her side. She was silent for a moment, then asked in the same quiet tone:

– Is there a café or restaurant nearby?

– No – I replied. – This is a quiet neighborhood, no places like that. And even if there were, they wouldn’t be open at this hour. It’s only eight in the morning…

Her anxiety was almost palpable. She shifted from foot to foot, adjusted her ponytail, as if the small gesture could calm her down. It was clear something was bothering her, something more than just the missing number 120. Maybe she was lost in an unfamiliar place, waiting for someone who was supposed to pick her up but wasn’t answering their phone. Or maybe she was just tired—from a long journey, lack of sleep, everything that had brought her here.

After a moment, lowering her voice and blushing slightly, she asked:

– What about a bathroom? Is there one nearby? Because… I really need to pee.

Her cheeks flushed a soft pink, and her gaze darted to the side, as if she was ashamed of the request. I smiled to myself—there was something disarming about it, that mix of shyness and honesty.

– Sorry, there isn’t – I answered, but after a moment, I added, half-joking: – Though… you could use mine. But only if you earn it.

She looked at me, surprised, and I continued:

– You see, before I let a stranger into my house, I need to trust them. And trust has to be earned. Like helping me with this hedge. Or other garden chores.

Her eyes flashed—I wasn’t sure if it was irritation or surprise. She shifted from foot to foot again, more nervously this time, and pleaded:

– Couldn’t I use the bathroom first? I was on a bus, I slept through the break, and the station restrooms were closed. I really don’t know if I can hold it.

There was more than just desperation in her voice—maybe exhaustion, maybe frustration. I pictured her on that bus: sitting in an uncomfortable seat, head against the window, trying to sleep while the engine rattled and fellow passengers talked too loudly. Maybe she was here for a job, to see family, or running from something—I had no idea, but she looked like someone who’d had a long journey, and not just in the physical sense.

I shook my head, pretending to be serious.

– My mom always said we don’t let strangers in unless we can trust them. And how can I trust a woman who can’t control her own bladder? – I said coolly. – If you need to go that badly, you’d better hurry. But I’m warning you: don’t let a single drop slip, or you’re not getting near my bathroom.

She froze. For a moment, she just stood there, staring at me with wide eyes. Her gray-green gaze flashed—maybe with anger, maybe humiliation. She pressed her lips together, her hands clenching into fists for a second before she forced them to relax. I could see her struggling—with the urge, with shame, with this bizarre situation she’d stumbled into. Finally, she set her suitcase aside and grabbed the trimmers, her movements stiff with tension.

– Fine, how much of this hedge do I have to trim? – she asked quietly, but there was more than resignation in her tone. There was a hint of defiance, as if she wanted to prove she wouldn’t break, even if the situation was overwhelming.

– Start over there – I pointed to an uneven section of the hedge. – And do it carefully. When you’re done, we’ll see if you’ve earned.

She looked at me again, longer this time, as if trying to gauge whether I was serious. Then, without a word, she walked to the hedge and started cutting branches. Her movements were quick but sloppy—the secateurs trembled slightly in her hands, and she kept shifting from foot to foot, fighting the discomfort. Strands of hair slipped from her ponytail and fell across her face, but she didn’t brush them away, focused on the task. There was something stubborn about her, something that said she wouldn’t give up, even if this all seemed absurd.

Her movements were stiff. The secateurs shook in her hands, and she kept shifting from foot to foot, battling the discomfort. Hair fell across her face, but she didn’t fix it, focused on the task. I watched her—her restless steps, the way she kept changing position, as if searching for relief. After a few minutes, when the branches were falling unevenly and she was still fidgeting, I snapped:

– Stop dancing around like that. You’re working sloppily, and it’s taking longer. That’s not getting you any closer to emptying that full, aching bladder of yours.

She froze, the secateurs hovering in the air. She looked at me, her eyes narrowing, her lips pressing into a thin line. I could see her fighting—not just the physical discomfort but the fury I’d sparked in her. But she didn’t reply. She took a deep breath, straightened up as if forcing her body to obey, and went back to cutting. This time, her movements were slower, more precise, though it clearly took effort. Sweat beaded on her forehead, and her hands gripped the secateurs so tightly her knuckles turned white.

When she finished, the hedge looked decently even. She stood in front of it, legs tightly pressed together, breathing heavily, the secateurs dangling in her lowered hand. I looked at her and pointed to the scattered branches.

– That’s not all. Sweep the sidewalk and collect the clippings into the bin.

She listened, standing with her legs squeezed together. Her hands instinctively moved toward her lower abdomen, as if trying to hold it, as if that could help. I saw her hesitate—she knew what was coming. Trimming was one thing; she could stand upright for that. But collecting? Sometimes you have to bend, sometimes crouch, and with a balloon in her belly, probably throbbing with pain, it wouldn’t be easy. Her gray-green eyes shot me a look of silent anger, but she didn’t protest. She grabbed the broom I pointed to and started sweeping.

Her movements were cautious, rigid. She swept with short, quick strokes, trying not to bend too much. When she had to pick up a larger branch, she froze for a moment, clenching her teeth. She straightened slowly, branch in hand, and tossed it into the bin. Crouching was even worse—she lowered herself onto one knee, keeping the other leg stiff, her face twisting in a grimace. But she did it. Step by step, branch by branch.

She swept and collected until, at one point, she didn’t fully straighten up. Bent over, she grabbed between her clenched thighs. Her face was pale, her eyes glassy.

– Please… – she whispered, her voice trembling. – I’m going to wet my pants…

I looked at her coldly.

– If you pee in my garden, it’ll ruin my mom’s favorite plants—and mine. Then you can forget about the bathroom.

She gritted her teeth, straightened up with effort, and went back to sweeping. After an hour, she finished all the tasks. She stood before me, shaking, both hands pressed between her crossed legs. Her face was pale, her eyes glassy, her breathing ragged.

– Alright – I said. – Now I’ll check if you’ve kept your end of the deal.

– What do you mean? – she asked, her voice nearly breaking with panic.

– I need to see if you’ve held it – I replied calmly. – Stand over there, between the thuja trees, so no one from the street can see, and pull down your leggings a bit.

She looked at me with panic but nodded, as if accepting yet another condition. She stepped between the thuja trees, still pressing her legs together. With hesitation, her trembling hands pulled her leggings down just enough to reveal a glimpse of her underwear. She stood rigidly, her face flushed with shame. I looked—her underwear appeared dry, no obvious stains. After an overnight trip in the heat, she might’ve been sweaty, but there was no sign of even a drop leaking.

– Alright – I said. – Looks like I can trust you. Come to the bathroom.

I led her to the small bathroom by the entrance. I stepped inside with her, just to make sure everything was fine, but before I could turn away, she, in a panic, yanked down her leggings and underwear to her knees, sat on the toilet, and started peeing. The sound was loud, unrelenting, like a wave she’d been holding back for hours finally breaking free. Her shoulders slumped, her eyes closed for a moment—relief painted across her face, though she still trembled. Caught off guard by her speed, I turned and stepped out, leaving her alone to finish in peace.

I stood in the hallway, leaning against the wall, listening to the faint flush of the toilet. After a moment, the door creaked open, and Olena—that’s what I called her in my head—stepped out. She looked different. Less tense, but her gray-green eyes still held a mix of shame, anger, and something like weary resignation. She adjusted her leggings, smoothed her t-shirt, and looked at me, as if unsure what to say.

– Thanks – she mumbled softly, her accent now gentler, as if relief had softened her voice’s edges. But she added, with a hint of bitterness: – Though you didn’t have to make me do all that.

I looked at her, raising an eyebrow.

– Rules are rules. I don’t let strangers in without a reason. You proved I can trust you. Want to rest? You don’t look like you’ve got the energy to run around town.

She stared at me, surprised, as if she hadn’t expected the offer after everything I’d put her through. She was silent for a moment, then nodded.

– Okay. But just for a bit.

I invited her to the kitchen. I poured water into a glass and set it on the table. She sat cautiously, as if still wary of the situation. She sipped slowly, clutching the glass with both hands, her gaze drifting around the room—over the old floor tiles, the photo of my mom on the wall, the stack of gardening magazines on the counter. Finally, she pulled out her phone and started typing, her brow furrowing.

– She’s not answering – she muttered, more to herself than to me. – She promised a job, an address… and now nothing.

I listened, piecing together her story in my head. A small town, gray houses, muddy streets. A mechanic father, a mother working in a shop. Olena, chopping wood and tending the garden since childhood. In Poland, she packed boxes for twelve hours a day, learning the language from tattered textbooks, dreaming of something better. Her cousin promised a job, but the address—number 120—turned out to be a fiction. Eight hours on a bus, no breaks, no restrooms. And then me, with my hedge, my broom, and my rules.

– Look – I said finally. – If you want, you can stay until evening. We’ve got an old couch in the living room. Maybe your cousin will get back to you. Or you’ll find another address.

Olena looked at me, her eyes narrowing slightly, as if searching for a catch. But after a moment, she nodded.

– Thanks – she murmured. – But I won’t stay long. I need to sort this out.

She stood, grabbing her suitcase and backpack. I offered to walk her to the main street, where it’d be easier to catch a bus. She walked beside me, quiet but less tense. When we reached the stop, she looked at me again.

– You’re weird – she said, a hint of amusement in her voice, as if she was finally allowing herself a bit of ease. – But… thanks. I guess.

I smirked.

– Good luck, Olena.

She turned and boarded the bus that had just pulled up. I watched as it drove away, her suitcase disappearing behind the glass. I walked back to the house, to the hedge that now looked better than ever. And though I didn’t know what would happen to her—whether she’d find her cousin, a job, or end up back in the warehouse—I had a feeling Olena would manage. She always did.

I love this szenario!

A girl is in a bus for hours, maybe all night long. She overslept the only peestop. At the morning she gets out from the bus.

Her bladder is full to burst, but there is no toilet at the bus stop, there is no toilet all around!! That sounds so hot and arousing.

The guy made her hold and watched her suffer!!!

I am glad you like it. There will be another part soon 🙂

I'm from Ukraine too. Our country is not very rich and there is a Russian military aggression against my country. So Ukrainian people suffer from violation, deception and other problems... I consider it would be better to tell about difficult situation, not to make this poor girl hold and work... I understand, it's a fictional story, but I had told my opinion.

It's not a criticism, it's rather wishing..

I am sorry if the story disappointed you. I do not want to spoil, but the war will be mentioned in the 3rd part.

Here's the 2nd part of Olena story. Contains pee desperation, maid outfit, a tiny bit of humiliation, and peeing in a toilet. At the end, we get to know some details from Olena life after "The Hedge"...

Olena, pt. 2 – The Return. Mom’s Room

It had been few months since that morning when Olena stood before my fence, dragging a suitcase with a broken wheel and pleading for a bathroom. The hedge still looked neat, though it needed minor touch-ups, and I, as usual, was busy in the garden, cutting dry branches. Suddenly, I heard a familiar clatter—suitcase wheels on the uneven sidewalk, one of them rattling just as annoyingly as before. I looked up and saw her. Olena. In gray leggings, a faded t-shirt with some sports brand logo, a small backpack slung over one shoulder. She looked tired, as if she’d been traveling again, but her gray-green eyes sparkled with that same quiet determination I remembered.

She stopped by the fence, adjusted her messy ponytail, and gave a faint smile.

– Hi – she said, her soft accent still a blend of Polish and something Eastern. – Don’t you need something cleaned in the house? Since you already trust me…

She caught me off guard. I set down the hedge trimmer, sizing her up.

– I let you in once, that’s true – I replied. – But what brings you back? Did your cousin give you the wrong address again?

Her smile faded for a moment, but she shrugged.

– Life didn’t work out. I thought… I could help. Like before.

She didn’t look like someone here to beg. She was sincere, as if she wanted to repay a debt or just needed a moment to catch her breath. I invited her inside.

– You can clean the house – I said. – Shelves, floors, windows. A lot of work. But… there’s a condition.

She looked at me, her eyes narrowing suspiciously.

– What condition?

– You have to change into a maid’s outfit – I replied, pointing to a box in the hallway. – My mom doesn’t allow house help to look sloppy. The outfit has to be proper, no leggings.

Olena raised her eyebrows, clearly surprised. She was silent for a moment, as if weighing whether I was joking. Finally, she sighed.

– Seriously? – she muttered, but added with a hint of humor: – What, bathroom at the end again?

I smiled to myself.

– If that’s what you want – I answered, unsure myself if I was joking or serious.

I led her to a small room where I’d left the outfit. It was a set my mom kept for “special occasions”—a black skirt barely reaching mid-thigh, a white top with a deep neckline, and black, skimpy panties to match, since the gray, practical ones she wore didn’t suit it at all. The outfit was too small for her—the skirt clung to her hips like a second skin, the top stretched tight across her chest, and the panties barely stayed in place, digging slightly into her skin. Olena looked at herself in the mirror, adjusted the skirt, and muttered something in Ukrainian, but she didn’t protest. Her cheeks were slightly pink, as if she felt the outfit revealed more than it covered.

She started cleaning with surprising energy. She began in the living room—vacuuming shelves, carefully wiping each trinket: porcelain figurines, old photo frames, Mom’s yellowed books. She knelt on the floor, scrubbing baseboards, the tight outfit restricting her movements. The skirt rode up every time she bent over, and Olena kept tugging it down, casting furtive glances to see if I was watching. She moved to the kitchen, cleaning the counter, sink, and tiles above the stove. She stood on tiptoes to reach the upper cabinets, the top lifting to reveal a sliver of her stomach. It was clear the outfit was uncomfortable—especially the panties, which must have pressed on her lower abdomen.

From time to time, she sipped water from a bottle she had in her backpack. I didn’t watch her constantly—I trusted her, and besides, I didn’t want to make her uneasy. But I’ll admit, in that outfit, she looked… captivating. She was aware the outfit was too tight—after every crouch, bend, or reach for a shelf, she adjusted the skirt and top, which slowed her work. Sometimes she paused, as if to catch her breath, her movements growing more cautious. I noticed she was shifting from foot to foot more often, sometimes pressing her thighs together while cleaning a window or scrubbing the floor. The water she drank and the tight outfit were taking their toll—her bladder must have been making itself known. I didn’t comment. A deal’s a deal. Occasionally, I glanced at her work, savoring the sight, but I left her be.

She spent the most time in the dining room. She cleaned the windows, climbing onto a chair to reach the upper edges. The panes gleamed, but her movements grew stiffer. When she stepped down, she adjusted the skirt, which had ridden up again, and for a moment pressed her hand to her lower abdomen before resuming work. The floor was next—she knelt, scrubbing the parquet, her breathing growing shallower. The tight top restricted her arm movements, and the panties, digging into her skin, must have amplified her discomfort. I could see her struggling—not just with dirt but with a growing need. Sometimes she closed her eyes for a second, as if trying to focus, her legs, even while kneeling, pressed tightly together.

After four hours, she came to me, slightly hunched, hands hovering near her hips. She stood with her legs squeezed together, her face pale.

– I’ve done everything, except one room – she said, her voice trembling with effort. – The locked one. But… I really need to pee. Can I use the bathroom?

I shook my head and pulled out a key.

– That’s my mom’s room – I said, opening the heavy wooden door, which creaked as if it hadn’t been opened in years. – It hasn’t been cleaned in a long time. Go in.

Olena looked at me in surprise but stepped inside. The room was like a time capsule—mahogany furniture, heavy curtains, a portrait of Mom on the wall, the smell of dust and old perfume. On the shelves were her things: crystal vases, hand-embroidered napkins, a collection of angel figurines.

– Take your time – I added. – This room requires special care. Every item you touch must be cleaned perfectly and put back exactly where it was. Mom doesn’t tolerate sloppiness.

Olena sighed, realizing this wouldn’t be quick. She started cleaning—carefully, reverently, but her movements grew increasingly rigid. She dusted each figurine, polishing it with a soft cloth, as if afraid to damage anything. When moving a vase, she had to bend over, and her face twisted in a grimace—the tight outfit pressed into her stomach, and her bladder must have throbbed with pain. She pressed her thighs together, sometimes placing a hand between her legs when she thought I wasn’t looking. While cleaning the windowsill, she paused, breathing heavily, and adjusted the panties, which dug in deeper.

After half an hour, she came out, her steps small, as if every movement risked disaster.

– Please… – she whispered, pale, hands between her thighs. – I can’t hold it. I’m about to wet my pants.

I looked at her calmly.

– You set the condition yourself. It’s your choice. But if you leak in Mom’s room, it won’t be looked upon kindly.

She clenched her teeth, her gray-green eyes flashing with anger, but she went back to work. She cleaned with increasing difficulty—every shelf, every napkin, every angel was torture. While vacuuming the rug, she had to bend over, her breathing growing ragged. Sometimes she froze, pressing her thighs together, as if fighting a wave that could overwhelm her. But she didn’t give up. She polished the frame of Mom’s portrait, her movements slow, precise, though they cost her immense effort. Finally, after another hour, she finished. The room gleamed, as if Mom might return to inspect every detail.

She stood before me, trembling, hands pressed between her legs. Her face was pale, eyes glassy, breath like a sob.

– I did it – she gasped. – Check, but quickly… please…

She lifted her skirt herself, revealing the black panties. On the dark fabric, it was hard to see anything, but they seemed dry. I nodded, though I wanted the moment to last longer, to etch her in my memory forever.

– Go – I said. – You know where.

She ran to the bathroom, not even closing the door. She collapsed onto the toilet, and the sound was so loud and intense it echoed through the house—an unbroken stream, like a river unleashed after hours of restraint. She peed for a long time, maybe a minute, maybe more, relief painted across her face. Her shoulders slumped, eyes closed, hands, still clenched on her knees, slowly relaxing. When she stood, she adjusted her skirt and stepped out, still trembling slightly.

– I don’t think I’ve ever had to go that badly – she said, leaning against the doorframe. – Not even that time by the hedge. I thought I wouldn’t make it. That I’d wet myself… in this outfit, in your mom’s room.

I looked at her, curious what had brought her back.

– Why did you come back, Olena?

She sat on a chair, still in the maid’s outfit, though she looked less tense now. She sighed, staring at her hands.

– Things didn’t work out – she began quietly. – My cousin promised a job, but it was a scam. I found another one, in a warehouse, but they treated me like trash. Yelling, overtime, dirty looks… – she paused, then added in a trembling voice: – hands that sometimes got too close. I decided to leave—maybe to another city, maybe back home, to Ukraine. But before I do… – she hesitated, her gray-green eyes meeting mine. – I had to come back. That day by the hedge… I thought about it a lot. At first, I was furious. Humiliated. Your rules, that hedge, checking my underwear… I felt like a child who had to prove something. But then… I understood. You gave me a chance. You could’ve chased me off, but instead, you let me in, gave me water, offered a couch. It was help, in a weird way. I wanted to repay you before I disappear. To show I can give something back, too.

Her voice trembled, as if the words took effort. I looked at her, at her pale cheeks, the strands of hair slipping from her ponytail. She was sincere, more than she’d been by the hedge. Something tightened in my throat. It hit me how I’d looked at her—back then, in the garden, in those leggings, and now, in this tight outfit. Were my looks wrong, too?

– I’m sorry – I said quietly. – If my looks… if you ever felt uneasy because of me.

Olena looked up, surprised. She shook her head.

– No, it’s not about you – she replied softly. – You’re… maybe a bit weird, with those rules, but kind. I know you wouldn’t hurt me… or anyone. That’s why I came today. To say goodbye before I leave.

– Want something for the road? – I offered. – You earned it. Now and back then.

She shook her head, her lips curving into a faint smile.

– I don’t want money. What I have is enough. I just wanted… to close this chapter.

She changed back into her clothes—gray leggings, faded t-shirt. She looked like the Olena from before, with her suitcase and backpack, ready for the road, ready for the next tough challenge life would throw at her. She headed for the door but paused in the doorway.

– Where’s your mom? – she asked suddenly, her voice soft, as if afraid of the answer.

I led her to Mom’s room. I pointed to the urn beneath the portrait. Olena froze, her eyes welling up. She stood there for a moment, silent, as if trying to process it. I’d explained everything with Mom’s rules, but Mom… Mom had been gone for a long time. Olena swallowed hard, her hands tightening on her backpack strap.

– I’m sorry – she whispered. – I didn’t know.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t need to. She looked at me one more time, her gray-green eyes full of sadness but also something warm, like compassion, or maybe gratitude.

– Thank you – she said. – For everything. And… I’m sorry if I did anything wrong.

I smiled faintly.

– You did everything perfectly. Mom would’ve been pleased.

Olena nodded, her lips twitching in a pale smile. She left, backpack over her shoulder, suitcase clattering on the sidewalk—just like when I first met her, but louder. I watched her disappear around the corner, her silhouette blurring in the afternoon light. I didn’t know where she was headed—another city, Ukraine, the unknown. But I knew this was goodbye. Olena had closed her chapter, and I had closed mine. I returned to the house, to Mom’s gleaming room, and—thanks to Olena—for the first time in ages, I felt everything was in its place.

Here's probably the last part. At first, I wanted to write only two parts. But half an hour after I thougth I finished and turned off the PC, I suddenly started to wonder if Olena would come for help when the war in Ukraine began in 2022 (it was before Kate95 post). I considered few different endings, but this one seemed the most interesting - it's closed and open at the same time 😉

This parts is emotional, with only delicate references to desperation/peeing. However, it explains how Olena influenced the life of "me" in the story...

Olena – Epilogue

February 2022 brought images that couldn’t be forgotten. The TV in the living room, usually silent, now roared with reports from the border. Thousands of people, mostly women and children, walked in the dark, with suitcases, bundles, or nothing at all. The war in Ukraine erupted like a thunderclap, and though I didn’t want to, I thought of Olena.

I didn’t know where she was. I didn’t know her last name, her phone number, not even the name of that small town she’d mentioned—gray houses, muddy streets. Once, I thought I saw her in a news clip from Medyka: a girl in a dark jacket, with a ponytail, dragging a suitcase. But there were hundreds of girls like that, exhausted, their eyes full of fear. I had no photo to ask about, nothing but the memory of her pale face by the hedge and her trembling voice in Mom’s room.

A strange unease gnawed at me, like something tightening in my throat—the same feeling as when I apologized for my looks. Poles opened their homes, organized transports, and to my own surprise, I caught myself waiting. That maybe Olena would appear at my fence again, with that broken-wheeled suitcase, asking for help. I didn’t know why I thought this—years had passed, and she had no intention of returning. Yet, looking at the urn beneath Mom’s portrait, I felt I’d tell her: “This time, there’d be no rules.”

Days passed, then weeks. Hope faded. Until one March evening, the doorbell rang.

There she stood—gaunt, with just a backpack, hair in disarray, but it was her. Olena. Alive. Her hands were chapped, her eyes shadowed, as if she hadn’t slept in weeks.

– Can I stay the night? – she asked quietly, without the spark in her eyes I remembered. – A few days, until I move on. Just… no rules. Not “like husband and wife,” like in those ads. And don’t make me beg for the bathroom… sometimes there was nowhere… – She hesitated for a moment. – A month on the road – she whispered. – Stations, cold halls, sometimes no food. I heard bombs before I escaped. People promised help, but some… took what they wanted. I endured because I had to.

I looked at her, at her emaciated frame, at the backpack that looked like it had been through hell. The urn beneath Mom’s portrait seemed to watch, but her rules no longer held me. I rushed to her, embraced her, as if it could stop time.

– Olena, you’re alive! – I whispered, my throat tightening. – I was so worried!

She stood in my arms, stiff, but didn’t push me away. She said nothing about family—whether someone stayed on the front lines or died under a blindly dropped bomb. She stayed longer than planned—a week turned into a month. We talked in the evenings, though her words were cautious, as if she feared revealing too much.

– I have a friend in Munich – I said. – He could arrange a job, a good one, where people are respected. You wouldn’t have to go blindly.

She nodded, her eyes calmer but still distant.

– Thank you – she whispered. – But I have to do it myself.

After a month, she packed her backpack.

– If I’m in need, I’ll come back – she promised, squeezing my hand.

– You’re always welcome, Olena – I replied, feeling an emptiness in my chest.

Olena left, but she left something behind—freedom. Her strength, her quiet survival, unknowingly shattered the chains of Mom’s rules that had kept me in this oversized house. I started thinking about change—maybe I’d sell this house, move somewhere else, break free from the past that was suffocating me. I didn’t know if Olena would return, perhaps years later, transformed, proud of what she’d achieved through her own work. But if she did, she might find only strangers at this address, and I’d be gone. In that moment, watching her silhouette fade, I hoped that wherever she went, she’d find peace—and that someday, somewhere, Olena would stand at my door again.
