Drones of desperation

On September 10, 2025, more than a dozen Russian drones flew over Poland. This event inspired me to write a story that, with its political-military backdrop and a greater emphasis on emotions, goes beyond the clichéd motifs of desperation on a plane. This is the story of Anna, a Polish doctoral student, returning from an important conference capped with a few days of relaxation on the French Riviera, who grapples with fear, uncertainty, and her own body.

Drones of desperation (part 1)

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent, please fasten your seatbelts,” the calm voice of the pilot jolted Anna awake from a deep sleep. She stretched, feeling a stiffness in her neck, and glanced at her watch. 00:47, September 10, 2025. How had she fallen asleep? Before boarding in Nice, she’d downed a large coffee to stay alert after an intense week. The coffee was supposed to keep her awake, but now she realized its other, more urgent effect—a growing pressure in her lower abdomen. She needed the bathroom. Now.

She stood, but before she could take a step toward the aisle, a flight attendant appeared beside her. “Please sit down and fasten your seatbelt,” she said, her tone polite but firm. Anna sighed and sank back into her seat, gripping the armrests. “We’ll land soon, I can hold it,” she told herself, trying to believe it. Her thoughts drifted to the past few days—the vacation on the French Riviera had been like a dream. Cannes, where she’d walked the famous red-carpeted stairs; St. Tropez, still fragrant with memories of old gendarme films; and the cozy hotel by the bay, where the waves practically lapped at her feet. But those few days of relaxation were just the cherry on top after the conference in Cap Esterel. That event was a breakthrough in her career—a young scientist, on the cusp of defending her doctorate, delivering a talk at such a prestigious venue. In Warsaw, another challenge awaited: a meeting with the reviewer of her dissertation, a moment that could shape her future.

The plane began its descent, swaying gently from side to side. Through the window, red lights blinked on the rooftops of skyscrapers sprouting across central Warsaw like mushrooms after rain. The days when the Palace of Culture was the city’s tallest landmark were long gone. Anna glanced out—houses, roads, and a few cars gliding through the midnight streets. Her watch read 1:02. The flight from Nice was supposed to land before midnight, but it had been delayed by chaos at the airport. “Just a few more minutes,” she thought, trying to ignore the intensifying pressure in her lower belly. She clenched her thighs, desperate to focus on anything else.

Suddenly, the plane lurched. The wings rocked violently, and the aircraft began climbing sharply. Anna felt a sharp pang in her abdomen and instinctively squeezed her legs tighter. “What’s happening?” raced through her mind. Her heart pounded. “Please, let it be nothing serious.”

“Ladies and gentlemen, due to operational reasons, we must interrupt our landing. Warsaw airport has been closed. Please keep your seatbelts fastened and remain seated,” the pilot’s voice was calm, but Anna detected a hint of unease, as if he were hiding something. “Operational reasons? What does that even mean?” she wondered, panic mixing with her physical discomfort. The pilot continued: “We are being rerouted to the alternate airport… in Katowice.”

“Katowice?” Anna muttered under her breath. That’s 300 kilometers from Warsaw! Sure, it was closer to her hometown of Krakow, but how would she make it to her meeting with the reviewer? What was going on? Why was the airport closed? Her bladder screamed for attention, and the uncertainty only made it worse. The plane climbed into the darkness, and Anna, trapped in her seat, felt time becoming her greatest enemy.

Great start! I really like your writing style and excited to see where this goes next

Thank you for nice words, I'm glad you like the story. Here's the next fragment:

The lights of Warsaw faded into the distance, dissolving into the night. Anna sat rigidly, hands gripping the armrests, battling the mounting pressure in her bladder. The cabin buzzed with tension—passengers’ hushed conversations mingled with the hum of the engines. A man a few rows ahead, ignoring the flight attendants’ discreet glances, hunched over his phone, struggling to get a signal. It was weak, barely a single bar, but he finally connected. Anna saw his face pale as he scrolled. “Russian drones over Poland… airports closed… NATO planes in the air… a downed drone… a house damaged near the Belarus border,” he whispered to the woman beside him, who covered her mouth in shock. The words reached Anna, sounding like fragments of a nightmare. War? Was this really happening?

Anna recalled a conversation with a radio enthusiast friend who’d told her about intercepting pilot communications with air traffic control. He had a portable device—something like a radio. A scanner, was that it? She wished she had one now. Maybe she could catch snippets of what was happening. She glanced at the flight attendants—their movements were too quick, their smiles too stiff, as if they knew more but were determined not to alarm the passengers, to prevent panic. Their tension only fueled her anxiety.

Her thoughts raced. Her bladder demanded attention, and she squeezed her thighs tighter, trying to maintain control. The blue-and-white dress, perfect for strolling through Nice, now had to conceal her nervous fidgeting. “Damn it, I’m going to wet myself,” she thought. She looked out the window. In the distance, lights streaked across the sky, moving fast. Suddenly, something larger flared—a distant explosion, then a fall to the ground. A shiver ran down her spine. “This is really war,” she thought, covering her mouth to stifle her fear. But she was also fighting her own battle—with a body that was increasingly defiant. During a sudden course correction, she felt a few droplets escape, soaking into her underwear. Her heart froze. She glanced down, panicked, checking for telltale stains on her dress. Nothing was visible yet, but fear gripped her throat.

As if sensing her desperation, the plane leveled off, and the seatbelt sign went out. Anna leapt up, nearly tripping over her own feet, and rushed toward the bathroom. She wasn’t the first—a small line of passengers already stood in the aisle, shifting nervously. Anna joined them, thighs clamped together, breathing shallow and rapid. Her entire body was taut as a wire, her bladder throbbing as if it might burst. “Just hold on,” she repeated in her mind, clutching the fabric of her dress at her hip. She cursed that coffee in Nice. Why not water? Or a drink? And why had she slept through her chance to use the bathroom earlier? She thought back to her first time teaching students—stress had made her need to pee then, too, but it was nothing compared to this. One person left in front of her. “Hurry!” she pleaded silently, but she felt her control slipping. A small trickle ran down the inside of her clenched thighs. She squeezed harder, battling waves of panic and humiliation.

Finally, the bathroom door opened. Anna burst inside, yanking up her dress and pulling down her underwear in one frantic motion. She began to relieve herself before even sitting on the toilet. Relief washed over her like a tidal wave—a shiver ran down her spine, her body slowly relaxing. She breathed deeply, fixing her hair. She’d made it. Almost. No visible damage, thankfully. But as she adjusted her dress and caught her reflection in the small mirror, she realized this was just the beginning. What awaited her outside? What next?

Anna stood in the middle of the arrivals hall at Katowice airport, feeling like she’d landed on another planet. She’d never been here before, though she’d heard it often took flights from Krakow when Balice was fogged in. Despite the late hour, the hall was a chaotic swirl of bewildered travelers—not just from her flight but from several others meant to land at Okęcie.

People darted back and forth, some trying to get a phone signal, others badgering staff about the situation in the country. “Is it war? What’s happening?”—whispers and shouts blended with the din of voices. The lines to the bathrooms stretched endlessly, and Anna sighed with relief that she’d made it to the airplane’s toilet. Just barely—her still-damp underwear was a reminder of that desperate, not entirely victorious struggle. It had been a double close call, as the pilot had ordered seatbelts fastened again right after she’d left the bathroom, as if fate was testing her limits.

It had all happened so fast—she was supposed to land in Warsaw before midnight, stay with her university friend Monika on Ursynów, and at 9:00, fresh and rested, meet with her dissertation reviewer to address some concerns. That meeting could make or break her career. But now? Rumor had it Wizz Air was arranging a bus to Warsaw, but where and when? And for everyone? Even if Anna got a seat, would she make it in time? How could she face the professor—exhausted, unrested, in a wrinkled dress, with damp underwear from her mishap on the plane? She should call Monika, but wake her in the middle of the night?

Or maybe Monika was awake, waiting, unaware of the chaos? She recalled an old LOT airline ad: “Closer with LOT.” Maybe she should’ve flown LOT? The LOT passengers seemed calmer, gathered in one corner of the hall. Bits of information filtered through the arrivals hall, the same scraps she’d overheard on the plane: Russian drones, closed airports, NATO in the air. Someone in the crowd was scrolling through their phone, reading aloud: “They say a drone was shot down over Lublin… or maybe Suwałki, I don’t know.” Nothing new, just more uncertainty.

Or maybe she should head to Krakow? Be with her family, her loved ones, her friends in these uncertain times? If only there were a bus. But how, in this mess, in this middle-of-nowhere airport far from any city, could she find any information? She thought of Michał, her university friend who always had everything under control. A walking atlas and timetable—even before the internet, he knew when, where, and how to get anywhere. But he had one infuriating habit: he turned off his phone at night. Anna stood frozen in the middle of the hall, the chaos swelling around her. In a corner, a middle-aged man in a disheveled blazer was yelling at an airport worker: “What do you mean you don’t know when the bus is leaving? This is a scandal!” The meeting with the professor was her academic future, but was it even relevant if war had broken out? Or what if it wasn’t war—just a provocation? A hoax? A live-action fake news event?

She stepped outside the terminal, hoping for a moment of clarity. The cool night breeze brushed her skin, reminding her of her still-damp underwear. She shivered, not just from the cold. What should she do? Every choice felt wrong. She returned to the hall, sank onto a plastic chair, propped her elbows on her knees, and buried her face in her hands. She longed for a hot shower, to wash away the exhaustion, the stress, the shame, to slip into clean clothes and sleep for a few hours. To wake up yesterday, before all this began. Nearby, a young woman comforted a crying girl, whispering, “Shh, sweetheart, we’ll find out soon.” The chaos roared around Anna, and she felt trapped—caught between her career, fear for the future, and a body that still wouldn’t let her forget its demands. What should she do?

(here's where the original idea ends, but who knows, maybe there will be a next part...)

A beautiful, well-constructed story with a perfect balance between the urge to urinate and the geopolitical context that gradually takes over as the chapters progress.

If you feel like continuing this story, perhaps focus on Anna's return to Warsaw via bus. Who knows, maybe she'll have experienced bladder control issues before the trip?

Currently, with the international context, drones in Romania and Denmark, and planes in Estonia, there's plenty of content to create many more wet stories.

Thank you! I am very glad you like the story. Actually, I was thinking about Anna calling Michael (in Polish: Michał), the one who has his phone asleep at night. There are some possibilities to include some military-related elements some of which I have observed myself. However the story in my mind evaluates towards some kind of romance between old friends which is not what want. Maybe, after some time, I will find the right way to continue. And I hope the international context will make the story more universal - which could be placed everywhere, not only in Poland 🙂
