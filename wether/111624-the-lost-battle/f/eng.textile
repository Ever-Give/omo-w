The Lost Battle

This is a story of Kate, a female soldier, tank driver. Tank was hit, her crew is killed, she is trapped alone in a wreck. She needs to pee... (written from her point of view)

Darkness. Thick, suffocating darkness that presses into my eyes, my mouth, my lungs. The stench of burnt oil and something else, something metallic, nauseating. Blood. Not mine. I think not mine. God, please, let it not be mine.

My heart pounds like a hammer, as if it wants to shatter my ribs and escape. I try to move my hand, but something stops me. Steel. The cold, jagged edge of the armor digs into my thigh. It hurts, but not enough to kill me. Not yet. My head throbs like someone’s driving a pickaxe into it, but I’m alive. I’m alive. The others… Oh God, the others.

– Mark? – I whisper, though I know it’s pointless. My voice cracks, rough, like it’s not mine. – Jacob? Anthony?

Silence. Only a distant crackle, as if the world is still falling apart. I try to remember what happened. The battle. The explosion. Fire. A shell hit our turret, that much I recall. Then… nothing. Darkness. And this wreck, now my tomb.

I was careful. I’m always careful. – Kate, drive steady, don’t charge – Mark, our commander, used to say. He’d laugh, saying I was like a cat, always landing on my feet. Where are you, Mark? Why can’t I hear your laugh? Why can’t I hear Jacob, who always cursed when things went wrong? Anthony… Anthony, you were always quiet, but this silence is too loud.

I try to move again, but every motion feels like a knife in my back. The tank is dead. The radio? Smashed, I see scraps of cables dangling like guts. The lights? Nothing. Even the damn emergency red button doesn’t work. I’m trapped. Alone. In the middle of this hell.

And then I feel it. That stupid, absurd sensation that feels almost offensive in this moment. I need to pee. God, really? The world is collapsing, my friends are dead, and I’m fighting my bladder? I’d laugh if I weren’t so terrified. But the feeling grows, stubborn, merciless. Like my body wants to remind me I’m still alive, still human, not just a lump of flesh trapped in a steel cage.

– Come on, Kate – I mutter through gritted teeth. – Not now. Not now.

But it doesn’t help. The pressure in my stomach builds, and every breath makes it worse. I try to focus on something else. On how to get out. On the fact that someone has to find me. Our guys don’t leave their own behind. Right? Right?

But what if they don’t? What if we lost? What if the enemy is close, and I’m lying here, defenseless, like a rat in a trap? I hear distant booms—maybe artillery, maybe just echoes in my head. I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s ours or theirs. I don’t know if anyone knows I’m here.

I try moving my leg again. The metal creaks, something snaps, but it doesn’t give. I’m like a fly in a web. I think of Mom. – Kate, you should’ve been a teacher, not joined the army – she’d say. – This isn’t for you, it’s for men – she’d repeat. But I was stubborn. I wanted to be like Dad. I wanted to be strong. And what good is that strength now? I’m stuck here, trapped in my own tank, with a bladder about to burst and a head full of fear.

– Don’t panic – I whisper, but it sounds like a plea. – Don’t panic, Kate. Think.

I think of the guys. How Mark always had candies in his pocket that he’d steal from Jacob. How Anthony would hum old songs under his breath when he thought no one was listening. They were my family. And now… now they’re gone. I feel tears sting my eyes, but I can’t wipe them away. I can’t even lift my hand.

And that damn bladder. It’s not just a need anymore. It’s pain. Sharp, burning, like someone’s stabbing needles into my lower abdomen. I clench my thighs, but it’s no use. I think about how stupid it would be to give up now. Like it’d be the ultimate proof I’m weak. But what can I do? Nothing. I can do nothing.

– Please – I whisper, not sure to whom. To God? To fate? To the guys who can’t hear me anymore? – Please, let someone find me.

The darkness grows heavier, like it wants to crush me. The air is thick, stifling. I feel sweat trickle down my neck, my heart racing faster. Or maybe it’s just my imagination? Maybe I’m already dead, and this is hell? No, I’m not dead. Not yet. I feel the pain. I feel this damn bladder. The dead don’t need to pee, do they?

I try to scream, but my voice turns into a rasp. No one will hear me. No one knows I’m here. I think about what happens if no one comes. Will I die of thirst? Of hunger? Will the enemy find me and… No, don’t go there, Kate. Don’t think about that.

Instead, I think of home. The smell of Mom’s dumplings. The dog that always licked my face when I came back on leave. Dad, who was so proud when he saw me in my uniform. – My little tankwoman – he’d say. Where are you, Dad? Why can’t you pull me out now?

My bladder wins. I feel warmth spread down my legs, and I cry. Not from pain, not from fear, but from humiliation. I’m a soldier. A tank driver. And now I’m pissing myself, trapped in a wreck, like a kid who didn’t make it to the bathroom. It’s so stupid, so human, so… real.

– I’m sorry – I whisper, though I don’t know to whom. To the guys? To myself? To this damn tank that was my home and is now my cage?

The darkness wraps around me. The distant booms fade. Maybe the battle’s over. Maybe everything’s over. I close my eyes, because it makes no difference. I wait. For help. For death. For anything.

But deep down, beneath all the fear and shame, I’m still Kate. The one who always lands on her feet. And if there’s even a sliver of a chance, I’ll find it. I have to. For Mark. For Jacob. For Anthony. For myself.

I wait.

Wow. This is literary. It is a very rare omo fic to make your reader feel so many things. If you've written on here before I'm sorry I missed them 😛 But you have a special talent and I hope you continue to bless us with it. ❤️

Thank you!

I've added some stories recently. But not as emotional as this one. You are welcome to read them 🙂

Damnit! I had an idea exactly like this a couple weeks ago and could never figure out how to put it to words.

Good work, mate.

Thank you very much! I am glad you like it 🙂

I have another war-related idea, maybe even more emotional but I am not sure if it is acceptable here because the main chacater kills other soldiers. War has its rights, but...

Reviewing the guidelines, it appears as though the only rule related to violence is *fetishization* of violence, namely DV or rape. There's 100% a murder or two somewhere on this site, and one of my favorites contains a shocking but perfectly topical strangulation. Go nuts.

In my story, the killing (acutally, shooting) is not fetishised. It is a "must do" in order to survive... kill or be killed... like in a war.

I'm not a mod or reviewer, just good at reading rules. If you're worried, I'd recommend making a post in the feedback thread asking for clarification.

Good idea, thank you!
