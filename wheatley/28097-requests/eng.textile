Ok, I'm gonna be honest here

After my Paper Mario TTYD story, I've been trying to come up with a new story for you guys. the problem is, I've developed writer's block. so I'm letting you decide.

Also, some conditions:

1. I can only do video game characters

2. I do females only, I'm not much for the male stuff

3. the video game characters thing is only limited to characters that I know of, so if you choose a character I don't know about, it may take a while longer or not be done altogether.

4. I'm still working on developing my story works, so don't expect the best out of me.

Well that's about it. go ahead and make your choice, I gotta go take care of spacey
