Hey, guys, I've had this idea for a long time about doing some sort of Halo omorashi. Something about seeing a female SPARTAN, made to be the best of the best have an accident would be amazing. I'll write it, I just need someone to help me out on choosing the character.

Cortana - Obviously, it'd be impossible to do unless perhaps John had a dream Cortana was real or something.

Kat- It'd be pretty fun to write about Kat. She's a very hot character.

Sarah Palmer- She's a new character from Halo 4, and I'd think she'd be amazing to write about.
